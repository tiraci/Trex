; Inno Setup script for the TREX Windows installer.
;
; This compiles dist\TREX\ -- whatever scripts\bundle-windows.ps1 just
; assembled and asserted -- into a single trex-<version>-x64-setup.exe.
;
; It deliberately knows nothing about the layout it is packaging. The bundle
; script is the thing that decides which files ship and fails when one is
; missing (a build without trex-screen-gate.exe runs every agent chat
; unenforced and otherwise looks normal); duplicating that list here would give
; it a second, silently divergent copy. So this takes the directory wholesale.
;
; Invoke via the bundle script, not directly:
;
;   ./scripts/bundle-windows.ps1 -Installer
;
; which is what supplies AppVersion and SourceDir below.
;
; NOTE: pure ASCII, and it has to stay that way. Inno Setup reads a .iss with no
; byte-order mark as ANSI, so a UTF-8 em dash here becomes three characters --
; harmless in a comment, corruption in a [Messages] string.

; Per-user, and not for want of ambition. Two reasons, in order:
;
; 1. crates/auto-update replaces TREX.exe and its siblings in place at quit
;    (crates/auto-update/src/windows/). A per-user directory it can write
;    unelevated is the only shape that works without shipping an elevated
;    helper service purely to copy files. The updater's own eligibility check
;    write-probes this directory and disables itself if it cannot write here,
;    so moving an install into Program Files by hand turns updates off rather
;    than failing them halfway.
; 2. Nothing here needs machine scope. Every writable path TREX touches is
;    under %LOCALAPPDATA% already (apps/desktop/src/app_paths.rs), so a
;    per-machine install would buy an admin prompt on every upgrade and change
;    nothing else.
;
; PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed is deliberately left at its default of
; nothing rather than set explicitly, so no override is offered: the elevation
; dialog would let a user pick Program Files and quietly opt out of (1).
