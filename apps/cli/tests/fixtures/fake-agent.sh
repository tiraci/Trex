# A stand-in for a real agent CLI, speaking just enough stream-json for the
# headless launcher to adopt it as a session.
#
# It exists to answer one question no in-process stub can: does an agent this
# host spawned actually *receive* the confined credential, and does that
# credential reach exactly one session? Everything below is in service of that.
#
# The host inherits its environment into us, so the test hands over what we
# need through it:
#
#   TREX_FAKE_AGENT_SESSION  the session id to announce, when the host names none
#   TREX_FAKE_AGENT_REPORT   file to append findings to
#   TREX_FAKE_AGENT_CLI      path to the TREX binary, for the confinement probe
#   TREX_FAKE_AGENT_DIR      the host's runtime dir, for --dir
#   TREX_FAKE_AGENT_STALL    if set, take the prompt and never answer it —
#                              the turn stays in flight, which is what the
#                              recovery suite needs to catch the host mid-turn
#
# and the *host* hands over TREX_SESSION_ID / TREX_SESSION_TOKEN, which is
# the thing under test. We never write the token anywhere — it is a live
# credential, and a fixture that leaked one into a file a test reads would be
# teaching exactly the wrong habit. Presence is all the test needs.

# that does not exist, and made the session id a race: the host waits a
# bounded moment for an announcement and otherwise keeps the id it chose, so
# under load the suite saw the host's id where it asserted ours. That is a
# fixture bug wearing a product bug's clothes, and it made three tests flaky.
#
# The env var stays as the fallback for a host that names nothing, which is
