//! The headless host spawning a **real agent process**, and what that process
//! is handed.
//!
//! Every other suite here stubs the launcher: `cli_e2e` registers a
//! `StubConnection` in-process, and `serve_e2e` says so out loud — "no agent CLI
//! is spawned anywhere here". That keeps them hermetic and fast, and it leaves
//! one claim unproven by construction, the claim the whole agent-CLI trust model
//! rests on:
//!
//! > every agent this host spawns is confined to its own session.
//!
//! A stub cannot show that. The credential is put into a child's *environment*,
//! so proving it needs a child with an environment — a real fork/exec, the real
//! `program_for_spawn("claude")` PATH resolution, the real stream-json decode,
//! and the real rebind from the opaque spawn handle onto the session id the
//! agent announces. This suite is that path, end to end.
//!
//! The agent is [`fixtures/fake-agent.sh`](fixtures/fake-agent.sh), reached by
//! putting a `claude` shim first on the host's PATH. Nothing in the production
//! path is aware of any of this: the launcher resolves `claude` exactly as it
//! would on a user's machine, and finds ours.
//!
//! One `sh` script rather than a `sh` + `.ps1` pair, for the reason
//! `crates/agents/src/thread/sh_fixture.rs` already established: Git for Windows
//! ships a full MSYS userland on every machine that can build this repo, and on
//! GitHub's `windows-latest` runners. Two scripts would mean two behaviours to
//! keep in step, of which the Windows one is the rarely-read half.

/// **The suite's reason to exist.**
///
/// A real spawned agent receives a real credential, and that credential reaches
/// its own session and no other. Four separate claims, each of which has to hold
/// for agent CLI access to be safe to leave on by default:
///
/// 1. the child is handed `trex_SESSION_ID` — it knows which credential it holds;
/// 2. the child is handed `trex_SESSION_TOKEN` — it can prove it;
/// 3. `ls` from inside sees exactly one session, its own — the opaque spawn
///    handle really was re-pointed at a registered session;
/// 4. a session-less full-host verb is **denied** — the confinement is a wall,
///    not a filter.
///
/// Claim 3 is the one only a real spawn can make. Everything up to the rebind is
/// stubbable; the rebind itself is a fact about a process that already exists.
/// The probe runs only once a prompt has arrived, which cannot happen before the
/// session is registered — so a successful `ls` from inside is an ordering proof
/// and not merely a permissions one. Before the rebind the same call is
/// fail-closed, the handle matching no session at all.
///
/// The expected id comes from the `run` reply rather than a constant: the host
/// names the session and the fixture adopts that name, exactly as the CLI it
/// stands in for does with `--session-id`. Asserting a constant instead meant
/// asserting that the fixture had won a race to announce, which is not a claim
/// this test is about and which it lost under load.
