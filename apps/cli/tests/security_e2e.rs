//! The security pass, as tests rather than as a checklist.
//!
//! Each of these is a claim that was previously argued from a code reading. The
//! difference matters: a code reading is correct until someone edits the code,
//! and none of these failures are loud. A leaked credential in a log is
//! invisible until it is exfiltrated; an inherited session marker costs a
//! transcript with no error anywhere; a world-readable key file looks exactly
//! like a private one until another account on the box reads it.
//!
//! Deliberately driving a **real** host with a **real** spawned agent, because
//! three of the four claims are about what crosses a process boundary.
