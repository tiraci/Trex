//! `TREX agent-status` — the command an installed hook actually runs.
//!
//! Every agent CLI TREX teaches to report runs this with a `--state`, and
//! hands it the lifecycle event as JSON on stdin. It resolves the pane it is
//! running in, asks the relay to frame the state as OSC-9999 on that pane's
//! output stream, and gets out of the way.
//!
//! **It must never fail the agent's turn.** Most agents run their hooks
//! synchronously, so this sits in front of the user's next reply; anything that
//! is not a mis-installed hook exits 0 and says nothing. A hook that reported
//! nothing costs a row its detail. A hook that errors costs the user their
//! turn.
//!
//! Dispatched before clap, like the desktop's copy, for two reasons: the flags
//! come from a file TREX itself wrote (a newer TREX may have written a flag
//! this binary has never heard of, which must be ignored rather than refused),
//! and clap answers an unknown flag by printing usage and exiting 2 — which is
//! exactly the failure the paragraph above forbids.
