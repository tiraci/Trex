///   A prompt built from a large diff or a pasted transcript reaches that, and
///   `Argument list too long` reads as a shell bug rather than a limit of this
///   command. The ceiling is high enough that this is the least of the three
///   reasons — the two below apply at every size.
/// - **Quoting.** A heredoc keeps the text exactly as written; embedding the
///   same thing in an argv string means escaping whatever the shell would eat.
/// - **Disclosure.** An argv prompt is visible in `ps` to every account on the
///   box and lands in shell history. On a shared server that is at odds with
///   how carefully the rest of this codebase treats what it writes down.
