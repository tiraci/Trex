//! `TREX hosts` and `TREX pair` — the client half of pairing, and the

//! `pair` and `hosts add` are one operation with two ergonomics: paste a link

//! Nothing in here prints a ticket, a seed, or a session token. The only
//! credential-shaped value that reaches the terminal is the endpoint id, which
