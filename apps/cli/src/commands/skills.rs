//! `TREX skills` — the agent-facing guides, served from the binary itself.
//!
//! Entirely offline. The guides are `include_str!`d, so `skills get` needs no
//! runtime, no network, and no host, and a guide can never describe a verb the
//! binary serving it does not have — the version that ships the guide is the
//! version that ships the parser. That coupling is the whole design: a guide
//! fetched from anywhere else is a guide that can be a release out of date,
//! and a wrong guide is worse than none, because an agent following it spends
//! a turn discovering the verb is gone.
//!
//! The [`tests`] module holds the other half of that guarantee: every command
//! a guide names is walked against the live clap tree at test time.
