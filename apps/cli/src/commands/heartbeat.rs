//! `TREX heartbeat` — a session's own recurring wake-ups.
//!
//! The verb an agent runs on itself: from inside a session it needs no
//! `--session`, because the host resolves the target from the credential the
//! agent is holding. An operator names one.
//!
//! **Cron, mapped onto the host's closed recurrence set.** The flag takes a
//! standard five-field expression because that is the notation people already
//! have in their fingers, but the host stores recurrence as three cases
//! (`every N minutes`, `daily at`, `weekly at`) and those cross the wire as a
//! closed enum. Widening that enum is not an option: `RecurrenceWire` rides
//! inside `Vec<ScheduleWire>` in a reply older clients already ask for, and
//! postcard would misparse every element after a new variant. So an expression
//! outside the mappable set is refused by name rather than silently rounded to
//! something near it — see [`parse_cron`].
//!
//! **Schedules moved past this in v23; heartbeats have not.** A full cron
//! expression now has a host-side home (`Recurrence::Cron`) and a wire to ride
//! on, but only for schedules: `Request::CreateScheduleV2` carries
//! `RecurrenceV2Wire`, while `Request::CreateHeartbeat` still carries the closed
//! `RecurrenceWire` and has no v2 twin. So `heartbeat --cron` and
//! `schedule --cron` accept different grammars for now — a known wart, not an
//! oversight. Widening this one means giving heartbeats the same V2 treatment
//! schedules got, degradation path included.
