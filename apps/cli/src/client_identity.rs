//! The CLI's app-signing identity, **one key per host**.
//!
//! Mirrors `trex_remote_host::identity`'s file+0600+readback pattern rather
//! than the phone's storage: `mobile-core` keeps its seed in the OS keystore
//! and rebuilds via `ClientSigner::from_seed`, which has no portable
//! equivalent here.
//!
//! **The weakening is real and is not papered over.** A raw Ed25519 seed in a
//! file is a weaker threat model than a hardware-backed keystore, and a CLI is
//! more likely than a phone to be sitting on a shared server. Three things
//! bound it: the file is owner-only and *verified so by readback* (a write that
//! cannot be restricted fails rather than proceeding), keys are per host so a
//! compromised enrollment does not transfer to the rest of the fleet, and
//! `TREX hosts rm` unpairs host-side so revocation does not depend on the
//! file. If OS-keyring integration is ever wanted for laptop installs, this is
//! the module it replaces.
