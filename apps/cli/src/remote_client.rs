//! Dialling a paired host over iroh, and the client half of its auth
//! handshake.
//!
//! The handshake is written here rather than reused from `remote-session`
//! because that crate's [`RemoteSession`](trex_remote_session::RemoteSession)
//! owns a demux pump: it multiplexes RPCs against a live event stream, which is
//! exactly right for the phone and exactly wrong for a CLI whose every verb
//! already drives one framed transport directly. What IS reused is everything
//! that must not be reimplemented — [`ClientSigner`] for the key, and
//! `registration_proof` for the one canonical proof construction both sides
//! agree on.
//!
//! Nothing here logs. A ticket carries a bearer secret and the reconnect token
//! is a bearer credential; neither may reach a terminal, a log, or `--json`.
