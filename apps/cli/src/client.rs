//! The lazy host client: nothing here runs until a verb actually needs the
//! host, so `--help`, `version` and `agent-context` never touch the socket.
//!
//! Every connection claims a scope: `TREX_SESSION_ID` in the environment
//! names the per-session credential this process holds, narrowing it to that
//! one session; its absence is an operator at their own keyboard. The host
//! enforces the claim — this side merely never omits it.
//!
//! `TREX serve` injects those variables into every agent it spawns; the
//! desktop app does not yet, so an agent there runs as the operator. See
//! `trex-remote-local`'s threat-boundary docs.
