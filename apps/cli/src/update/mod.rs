//! Self-update: fetch a signed release manifest, prove it, and replace the
//! CLI and the relay together.
//!
//! The trust chain, in the order it must run and for the reason it must run in
//! that order:
//!
//! ```text
//! minisign signature over manifest.json   ← the only independent trust root
//!   └─ manifest parsed (never before)
//!        └─ version strictly greater than the running one
//!             └─ archive fetched, sha256 checked against the signed manifest
//!                  └─ extracted, platform gate, paired swap
//! ```
//!
//! The first step is what makes the rest worth anything. A sha256 taken from a
//! manifest published beside the artifact it describes proves only that the
//! download matches what the publisher said; a compromised publish token
//! rewrites both. The signature is checked against a key compiled into this
//! binary, which that token cannot reach.
//!
//! Nothing here ever restarts a running `TREX serve`. On unix the running
//! process keeps the image it already mapped, so a host stays up across the
//! swap and picks the new binary up whenever its service manager restarts it —
//! which is the service manager's decision, not this command's.
//!
//! Every step above except the last two lives in
//! [`trex_auto_update::release`], shared with the desktop app's in-app
//! updater. What stays here is what is actually about *this* program: which two
//! binaries it owns, how they come out of a `.tar.gz`, and how a failure is
//! rendered into the CLI's JSON envelope.
