//! The per-session event pump — serve's stand-in for the desktop's chat view.
//!
//! On the desktop, a view drains the agent's event receiver, feeds the
//! registry (so remote subscribers see the stream), folds the transcript, and
//! persists it. Headless, this task does exactly those four things and nothing
//! else: drain → ingest → fold → persist. One pump per live session; it ends
//! when the agent's event channel closes or serve drains for shutdown.
