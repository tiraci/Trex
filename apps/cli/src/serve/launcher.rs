//! The headless [`SessionLauncher`]: spawn an agent, learn its session id from
//! `SessionInit`, register it, and hand the stream to a pump. No tab, no view
//! — the pump is the whole "UI".
//!
//! **Every agent this host spawns is confined to its own session.** Before the
//! child exists it is granted a local-control credential and handed it in its
//! environment, so the `TREX` CLI it runs reaches that one conversation
//! rather than the whole host. The ordering is the awkward part: a session's id
//! arrives with the agent's own `SessionInit`, *after* the environment is
//! fixed, so the credential is minted under an opaque handle and re-pointed at
//! the real id the moment it lands. The window in between is fail-closed — the
//! handle matches no session, so a call made in it reaches nothing.
