//! Embed the Windows application icon into `TREX.exe`.
//!
//! Two things read this icon and neither of them reads a file:
//!
//! * **Explorer / the taskbar / Alt-Tab** read the executable's `.rsrc`
//!   section. An icon shipped alongside the binary is an icon nobody sees.
//! * **GPUI's window** calls `LoadImageW(module, PCWSTR(1), IMAGE_ICON, …)`,
//!   which is why the resource is emitted at **ID 1** specifically. Any other
//!   id compiles, links, ships, and leaves the window with the default
//!   placeholder — with nothing anywhere saying why.
//!
//! GPUI already embeds *its* resource at ID 1: the application manifest
//! (`RT_MANIFEST`, type 24) that turns on per-monitor DPI awareness and common
//! controls. Ids are scoped per resource type, so `1 ICON` (type 14/3) and
//! `1 RT_MANIFEST` coexist rather than collide, and both are wanted.
//!
//! The `.rc` is generated into `OUT_DIR` rather than checked in so it can name
//! the icon by absolute path. A checked-in `.rc` has to spell the path relative
//! to whatever directory `rc.exe` happens to resolve from, which differs
//! between the MSVC and GNU toolchains — a portability question with no
//! upside, since the file's entire content is one line.
//!
//! The icon itself is derived from the macOS `.icns` by `cargo run -p xtask --
//! icon`; see `xtask/src/icon.rs` for why it is generated rather than drawn.
