//! The desktop's handle on the shared relay-backed [`TerminalSource`].
//!
//! The implementation lives in `trex-relay-terminals` (extracted so
//! `TREX serve` exposes the same terminals the same way); what stays here is
//! the desktop's install pattern — a `OnceLock` published from the relay boot,
//! because the relay comes up before the `RemoteControl` global exists and the
//! two are installed in different scopes. This mirrors
//! `install_shared_backend`, which publishes the terminal backend from the
//! same boot step for the same reason.
