//! The local control listener's lifecycle: accept CLI connections on the
//! owner-only socket, map each authenticated claim onto a dispatcher scope,
//! and take everything down — listener AND in-flight connections — the moment

//! A fresh bearer token is minted at every bind and written (owner-only,
//! readback-verified) by the bind itself, so a token can never outlive the
//! listener that honors it: toggling local access off and on rotates it.
