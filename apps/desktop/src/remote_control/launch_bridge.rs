//! The inbound half of remote control: a launch request crossing from the
//! dispatcher's tokio task onto the GPUI thread, and its answer coming back.
//!
//! Every other remote capability reaches something the registry already holds —
//! a live `AgentConnection` — and needs no UI involvement. Starting a session is
//! the exception: it opens a tab, resolves a backend, and spawns a child
//! process, all of which only the view layer can do.
//!
//! So this is the first inbound path in the codebase. The direction is new; the
//! mechanism is not. `RemoteControl::subscribe_pairings` already carries
//! notifications *out* to a `cx.spawn` loop that updates a GPUI entity through a
//! `WeakEntity`; this is the same bridge pointed the other way, with a oneshot
//! riding along so the caller learns the new session's id rather than polling
//! for it.
