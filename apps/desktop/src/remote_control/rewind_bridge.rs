//! The inbound rewind path: a rewind request crossing from the dispatcher's
//! tokio task onto the GPUI thread, and its answer coming back.
//!
//! Second user of the bridge shape [`launch_bridge`](super::launch_bridge)
//! introduced, and for the same reason: `AsyncApp` is not `Send` while the
//! dispatcher runs on a multi-threaded tokio runtime, so the RPC task cannot
//! touch GPUI at all. It parks on a oneshot and the GPUI loop answers it.
//!
//! It differs from the launch bridge in one way that matters. Launching picks a
//! window deterministically because a new session has no home yet; a rewind
//! names an *existing* session, so this has to find the exact view holding it —
//! across every window, every project (including ones the user has switched
//! away from), and every tab.
