//! WorkspaceRoot — the top-level view mounted into the GPUI window.
//!
//! Composition (per-column workspace pattern): three columns side-by-side,
//! each topped by its own 40px header strip. There is NO full-width chrome
//! row — the workspace tab strip is confined to the center column's width
//! so it never extends across the side panels.
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌──────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┐
//! │ left header  │ center header               │ right header     │  ← 40px
//! │ (chrome)     │ (workspace tab strip)       │ (activity + ×)   │
//! ├──────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────┤
//! │              │                             │                  │
//! │ left rail    │ active project's pane groups │ right sidebar    │  ← flex_1
//! │ (250px)      │ (flex_1)                    │ panel (360px)    │
//! │              │                             │                  │
//! ├──────────────┴─────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┤

//! └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! When a side panel is collapsed, its column disappears entirely and the
//! chrome bits (wordmark/toggles) move into the center header so they stay
//! reachable — mirrors the `titlebar-left` floating behavior found in
//! similar workspace shells.
