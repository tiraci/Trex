//! callback (panel ops, diff fetch, status poller) without each one having

// Windows decides at link time whether a process gets a console. A
// console-subsystem binary launched anywhere but from an existing console —
// Explorer, the debugger, a Start menu pin — makes Windows conjure one, and on
// a machine whose default terminal is Windows Terminal that console is a
// persistent empty "Terminal" window that outlives the app as a dead pane.
// Debug builds used to accept that in exchange for `cargo run` logs; they no
// longer have to, because `attach_parent_console` below reconnects to the
// launching console when there is one. So: GUI subsystem for every build, and
// anything that must survive a launch with no parent console has to reach a
// file or the event log, not `eprintln!`.

/// Join the console this process was launched from, if there is one.
///
/// The binary is GUI-subsystem (see the crate attribute), so Windows never
/// creates a console for it. This call is the other half of that choice: when
/// a console-launched dev run (`cargo run`, `.\TREX.exe` in a shell) does
/// have a parent console, attach to it so `tracing` output lands there and
/// Ctrl+C still reaches the process. Launched from Explorer or the debugger
/// there is no parent console, the call fails, and that failure is the
/// desired outcome — no window.
///
/// Debug builds only — the same recipe as Zed's, which gates its
/// `AttachConsole` behind an explicit `--foreground` flag. The gate exists
/// because attaching couples the process to the console's window: close that
/// terminal and Windows ends every attached client, which is right for a dev
/// run and wrong for a release app someone happened to start from a shell.
/// Build profile stands in for Zed's flag until TREX grows a CLI surface.
///
/// Ordering: must run before `init_tracing` (and any other stdio use), because
/// the std handles are resolved on first use. Handle semantics are Windows's,
/// not ours: `AttachConsole` rebinds the std handles only when the parent did
/// NOT pass explicit ones (`STARTF_USESTDHANDLES`), so a redirected
/// `cargo run > log.txt` keeps its pipe.
