//! Floating usage popover — a borderless panel **window** hosting the usage
//! card above the inline browser.
//!
//! Why a separate window: the inline browser's webview is a native view
//! layered over the GPU canvas, so an in-window GPUI element can't be drawn on
//! top of a visible page. A `WindowKind::PopUp` panel composites at the
//! popup window level (above every normal window's native child views), so the
//! themed card floats over the page without hiding it.
//!
//! Dismissal (the tricky part): GPUI has no cross-window "click outside" event,
//! so the panel opens focused and closes when it resigns key — i.e. the moment
//! the user clicks anything else — plus an explicit Escape. The owner debounces
//! re-open so the same click that dismisses (on the status-bar chip) doesn't
//! immediately reopen it.
