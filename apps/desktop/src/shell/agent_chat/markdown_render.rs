//! Chat markdown: a parsed block tree becomes GPUI elements.
//!
//! Pure and `cx`-free, like [`super::bubble`] — every function here is a
//! function of the block, the theme and the typography, and nothing else. That
//! is what makes the whole renderer testable without a window.
//!
//! ## The rule the rest of the phase depends on
//!
//! **Numbers drive layout; colors are paint.** Every value that can move a
//! pixel — text sizes, line heights, paddings, the gap between blocks — is an
//! explicit number resolved before anything draws. Nothing that arrives late is
//! allowed to be one of those numbers.
//!
//! That is not a style preference. Syntax highlighting is computed off the
//! layout path and lands a frame or more after the fence is already on screen;
//! if a color could change a measured height, every late arrival would reflow
//! the transcript under the reader. Because it cannot, highlighting is free to
//! be as late as it likes.
//!
//! ## Why the inline layer is one `StyledText` per block
//!
//! A paragraph with three bold words is one text element with three styled
//! ranges, not seven nested elements. Nesting elements for emphasis would break
//! the line-wrapping across them — the words would wrap as separate boxes — and
//! it would multiply the element count of a long reply by the number of times
//! the author reached for `**`. `StyledText` takes exactly the shape the parser
//! already produces: a string plus ranges.
