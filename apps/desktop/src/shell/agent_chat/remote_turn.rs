//! Turns that were started from a paired phone rather than from this desk.
//!
//! Two things happen when a prompt arrives over the remote RPC. The obvious one
//! is cosmetic: the desktop shows the user's own bubble, because no backend
//! echoes a prompt back and the chat would otherwise display a reply to
//! something it never rendered.
//!
//! The other is a safety gate. Screen control assumes a person is watching the
//! screen being driven and can answer a consent card that appears on the
//! desktop; from a phone they can do neither, and a remote prompt is opaque text
//! — "click Delete and confirm" is indistinguishable from any other instruction,
//! so the device's write tier cannot tell them apart. The turn is therefore
//! marked, and `trex_computer_use::policy` refuses every screen-control call
//! reached from it.
//!
//! The mark lives here rather than in the session registry for a plain reason:
//! it is keyed by the chat's screen-control session id, and this view is the only
//! thing that holds one.
