//! Automatic re-send of a turn that failed on a provider limit.
//!
//! The policy — what counts as retryable, how long to wait, how many times —
//! lives in `trex_agents::retry` and is pure. This module holds only the
//! per-chat state and the timer, so the decision stays testable without a view.
//!
//! The re-send itself reuses `retry_last_turn`, the same path the manual Retry
//! button drives: it respawns a stopped child, resends the last user entry
//! verbatim, and re-anchors the turn checkpoint. An automatic retry that sent
//! by some other route would drift from the manual one, and the two would
//! disagree about exactly the edge cases that are hard to test.
