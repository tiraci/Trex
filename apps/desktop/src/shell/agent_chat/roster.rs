//! Connection-independent chat-agent roster for the unified "New Agent" composer.
//!
//! The unified composer lets the user pick a coding agent **and** a model before
//! any subprocess exists, so it cannot read the live `AgentConnection::models()`
//! (which only reports after a session is bound). This module assembles that
//! pre-bind vocabulary from the two static sources TREX already owns:
//!
//! - the detected adapter registry — built-in Claude/Codex, carrying their
//!   declared static model/effort lists (`RegistryEntry::models`/`::efforts`),
//! - the ACP presets (Cursor/Amp/OpenCode) from settings,
//!
//! filtered to chat-capable agents (terminal-only adapters and the Custom
//! escape hatch are dropped, matching the launcher's chat rows). Availability
//! (which-detection) and the live post-bind model list are layered on by the UI;
//! this module is a pure, connection-independent lookup.
//!
//! Placed in the app crate because `trex-agents` (model lists) and
//! `trex-settings` (transport + presets) are sibling crates that don't see
//! each other — the app is the one place both are visible, alongside the sibling
//! resolver `chat_backend_for`.

// A few roster fields (e.g. `efforts`) are carried for completeness and future
// phases but not yet read by the composer's pre-bind pickers (which offer agent
// + model only); allow the staged dead code rather than dropping fields that
// belong on the vocabulary.
