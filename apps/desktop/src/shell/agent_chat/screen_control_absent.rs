//! The shape screen control leaves behind on platforms that do not have it.
//!
//! Computer use is macOS-only for now (see `docs/windows-port-exclusions.md`).
//! But the chat view that hosts it is one of the largest surfaces in the app,
//! and threading `#[cfg]` through its ~35 screen-control touchpoints would put
//! platform conditionals in the middle of the transcript renderer — the code
//! most likely to be edited by someone thinking about something else entirely.
//!
//! So the three macOS modules keep their names here and answer "there is no
//! such thing" to everything. That is a real answer, not a stub that pretends:
//!
//! - `is_screen_call` is a **name predicate over the transcript**, so it stays
//!   truthful rather than constant-false. A transcript written on a Mac and
//!   read here still contains screen-control calls, and labelling them
//!   correctly is the whole job of the card renderer.
//! - Everything that *acts* — deciding, approving, granting — is absent. No
//!   call can arrive to decide about, because nothing here can produce one.
//!
//! Deleting this file means putting the `cfg`s back, not gaining anything.
//!
//! # Windows still gets the policing hook, and that is not a contradiction
//!
//! This file used to connect **without declaring** anything, on the grounds
//! that there is "no capability to police". That was true when written and is
//! false on Windows, for a reason that inverts the macOS argument.
//!
//! On macOS the side door exists because TREX *holds* an Accessibility grant
//! and every child inherits it — the capability is delegated, so removing the
//! delegation removes the reach. On Windows there is no grant to hold or
//! inherit: `SendInput`, window messages, and UI Automation are available to
//! any unelevated process in the interactive session, always. The capability is
//! **ambient**. It does not arrive with the driver and it does not leave with
//! it, so an agent's shell here can drive the screen on a machine where screen
//! control was never installed, never enabled, and cannot be.
//!
//! `docs/windows-port-exclusions.md` states the rule as "the moment any
//! screen-driving capability lands on Windows, the policing hook has to land
//! with it". The capability was already there. So the hook is declared, on
//! every Claude chat, with **no driver and no tools** — which is the tier the
//! macOS module calls the wider one, and the only tier that applies here.
//!
//! What is *not* declared is any MCP server: there is no verified driver to
//! point at (Phase 2 of `plans/260801-0157-windows-computer-use/`), and
//! `trex-computer-use` refuses to build one on Windows regardless.
