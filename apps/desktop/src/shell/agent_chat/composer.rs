//! The bottom composer row of the agent chat — a single-line input and a Send
//! button — isolated into its OWN entity/view.
//!
//! Why a separate entity: a text input only repaints its typed characters when
//! the view that OWNS it calls `cx.notify()` on each `Change` (gpui-component's
//! `InputState` does not self-repaint when embedded via `Input::new`). If that
//! `notify` lived on `AgentChatView`, every keystroke would rebuild the entire
//! transcript (every bubble + tool card) — visible typing lag. By owning the
//! input here, a keystroke dirties only THIS view; the transcript above stays
//! cached. Submit is surfaced to the parent as a [`ComposerEvent`].
