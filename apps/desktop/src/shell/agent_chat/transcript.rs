//! The scrolling transcript: how a `Vec<ThreadEntry>` becomes rows on screen,
//! and every scroll primitive the rest of the chat drives it with.
//!
//! Split out of `mod.rs` unchanged. The three consumers that jump around the
//! transcript — the tick rail ([`super::message_rail`]), the jump list
//! ([`super::jump_menu`]) and the find bar ([`super::find_bar`]) — all address
//! it through the primitives here rather than touching the scroll handle
//! themselves, so there is one place that knows how an entry index becomes a
//! scroll position.
//!
//! That translation is the awkward part and the reason this module exists as a
//! unit: entries do **not** map one-to-one onto scroll children. A collapsed
//! tool run renders nothing, an expander renders a child with no entry behind
//! it, so [`user_turn_child_indices`] and [`entry_child_indices`] rebuild the
//! map every frame from the flags the render loop just produced.

    /// behind a frame. A long reply used to be a single row, so any part of it
    /// being on screen meant building all of it — every paragraph, every fence —
    /// on every token. Split into block rows, a frame builds the blocks in the
    /// viewport and its overdraw band and stops.
    ///
    /// So the assertion is that the per-frame cost stops tracking the reply:
    /// double the message and a token still costs the same frame. Measured at
    /// 100 blocks in a 600px viewport, a token rebuilds **37** blocks; at 200
    /// blocks it rebuilds 37 again.
    ///
    /// Verified to bite: put the body back on the head row and stop emitting
    /// block rows — the pre-phase arrangement — and the same token rebuilds
    /// **101 of 100** blocks, and 201 of 200.
