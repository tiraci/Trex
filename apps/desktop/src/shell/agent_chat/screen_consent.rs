//! Copy and affordances for a screen-control consent card.
//!
//! Not a fourth card implementation: the ordinary tool card renders this, the
//! same way it renders an MCP elicitation. What lives here is the part that is
//! specific to being asked *"may an agent click on this app for you?"* — naming
//! the target, warning when the target's category makes one click worth much
//! more than one click, and offering a durable "always allow" that a tool
//! approval does not have.
//!
//! # Why the target is resolved once, not per repaint
//!
//! Naming an app costs a `codesign` spawn. A card can be on screen for minutes
//! and repaints many times a second, so the resolution happens when the card
//! goes up and the result is held until it is answered.
