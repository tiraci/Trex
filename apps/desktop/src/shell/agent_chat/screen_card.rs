//! How a computer-use call reads once it is over.
//!
//! "Computer use" is the user-facing name throughout — the settings pane, these
//! cards, the run summary. Internal identifiers still say `screen_*`, which is
//! the older spelling and is left alone deliberately: renaming `ScreenControl`
//! and friends would touch every phase's code for no reader's benefit, and the
//! crate underneath has always been `trex-computer-use` anyway.
//!
//! By default these render through the generic MCP path:
//! `trex-computer-use · type_text` with a line of raw JSON under it, thirty
//! times in a row. That is a log, not a record — and this is the one tool family
//! where the transcript *is* the audit trail, because the actions happened in
//! windows the user was not looking at while the agent drove them.
//!
//! Everything here is presentation, and deliberately so: by the time any of it
//! runs the policy has already decided, the gate has already refused what it was
//! going to refuse, and nothing below can change what happened. It is all
//! strings, which is also what makes it testable without a window.
//!
//! # Why the app is named from a memo rather than resolved here
//!
//! Turning a pid into an app name is cheap, and it is only *correct* while that
//! process is alive. A transcript reloaded the next day holds pids that have
//! since been recycled, and resolving one then would confidently name the wrong
//! app — in an audit trail that is worse than naming none. So the name is
//! whatever this chat resolved when the call was *decided*, held by
//! [`ScreenControl`](super::computer_use::ScreenControl) and handed here through
//! [`ScreenContext`](super::screen_consent::ScreenContext). A call with nothing
//! remembered says `process 4321` rather than guessing, which is also what a
//! restored transcript shows — the memo is deliberately not persisted.
