//! Fold companion-terminal turns back into the chat transcript.
//!
//! A chat tab's companion terminal (⌃⇧V) resumes the SAME session id
//! interactively, so turns typed there land only in the CLI's session log
//! (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<sid>.jsonl`) — nothing arrives on the chat
//! view's connection, and without this the chat silently renders a stale
//! transcript until the tab is reopened from history. The hook is the switch
//! back from Terminal to Chat view ([`AgentChatView::set_view_mode`]): re-fold
//! the log off the UI thread and append the suffix the thread hasn't seen.
