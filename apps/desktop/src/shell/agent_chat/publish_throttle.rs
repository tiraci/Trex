//! Rate-limits the remote transcript snapshot.
//!
//! [`AgentChatView::publish_remote_transcript`] serializes the *whole* fold, and
//! it used to run on every settled batch — so a turn that made twenty tool
//! calls re-serialized the entire conversation twenty times, each pass O(all
//! entries ever). In a long chat that is the dominant cost on the settled path.
//!
//! The obvious fix is not the right one. A revision gate — the shape
//! persistence uses, comparing `ChatThread::revision()` against the last
//! published value — cannot skip anything here: `ChatThread::apply` bumps the
//! revision unconditionally on entry (deliberately, "an event that folds to
//! nothing still bumps"), and this path is reached only after a non-empty
//! non-delta batch has been applied. Every call therefore arrives at a fresh
//! revision. The gate would compile, read as a fix, and never once skip.
//!
//! What actually removes the work is coalescing, and the design already permits
//! it. The snapshot exists so a client *opening* the session sees full history;
//! one that opens mid-stream folds live deltas from the backlog on top of the
//! last settled snapshot. That contract tolerates a snapshot a moment behind —
//! so publish at most once per [`PUBLISH_INTERVAL`], with a trailing publish so
//! staleness stays bounded even when the events stop.
//!
//! Bind and rekey deliberately do NOT come through here. A freshly bound peer
//! has no snapshot at all, so it needs one immediately rather than up to an
//! interval later; those sites call [`AgentChatView::publish_remote_transcript`]
//! directly.
//!
//! Same shape as `notify_throttled` one screen up, on purpose — leading edge,
//! single queued trailing call, flag cleared by whoever fires.
