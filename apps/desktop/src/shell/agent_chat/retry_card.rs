//! Pure (cx-free) renderer for the queued-retry card.
//!
//! Shown in place of the error card when a turn failed on a provider limit and
//! the app has scheduled itself to send it again. The card exists so a waiting
//! turn never looks like a forgotten one: it names why the turn is held, when
//! it will go, and gives the user both overrides — send it now, or drop it.
