//! The chat's "Add issue or pull request" picker: a modal list of the repo's
//! open issues and pull requests, opened from the composer's attach menu, whose
//! chosen item lands as a `@issue` / `@pull-request` context chip.
//!
//! Split of concerns matches the rest of the chat's context plumbing: the
//! composer only *asks* (it emits [`ComposerEvent::OpenForgePicker`]), because
//! listing needs the chat cwd and the forge CLI, and only the owning
//! [`AgentChatView`] has those. Everything here is either pure (the filter) or a
//! render of state the view holds.
//!
//! One listing pass, filtered in memory: issues and pull requests are fetched
//! together when the picker opens and the query box narrows what was fetched
//! rather than re-querying per keystroke. That keeps typing off the forge CLI,
//! which is a network round-trip per invocation.
//!
