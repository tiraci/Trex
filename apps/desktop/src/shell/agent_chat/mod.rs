//! Agent Chat view — a dedicated tab that renders a Claude Code session as a
//! structured chat thread (user/assistant bubbles, streaming text, collapsible
//! thinking, tool-call lines) instead of a raw terminal.
//!
//! It owns a [`ChatThread`] (the gpui-free conversation model from
//! `trex-agents`) plus a live [`AgentConnection`] to a headless `claude`
//! subprocess. Decoded events arrive on a background channel; a foreground task
//! folds each into the thread and repaints. The raw-PTY terminal agent path is
//! untouched — this is an additive second surface.
//!
//! Fail-closed: if the subprocess dies (stdout EOF) while a permission is
//! pending, the drain task rejects it rather than leaving a dangling prompt.
