//! Restore-side session lifecycle: dormant boot + transcript save gating.
//!
//! Two halves of the same contract — a restored chat costs nothing until it
//! is looked at, and an unchanged chat costs nothing when it is saved:
//!
//! * **Dormant boot.** `new_resumed` spawns NO subprocess; the view comes up
//!   resumable-idle and [`AgentChatView::ensure_connected`] performs the
//!   deferred connect. A resumed CLI re-reads its entire session file at
//!   startup, so a layout with several chat tabs would otherwise launch that
//!   many concurrent cold starts at boot — the >10s "app won't open" case.
//! * **Dirty-gated save.** The autosave/quit capture serializes every open
//!   chat's transcript; long sessions run to tens of MB of JSON, so
//!   [`AgentChatView::transcript_snapshot_for_save`] returns the body only
//!   when the chat changed since the last committed save. "Changed" is
//!   [`ChatThread::revision`](trex_agents::thread::ChatThread::revision)
//!   (bumped inside every thread mutator — one chokepoint, not N call
//!   sites) plus a small view-side mark for blob fields the thread doesn't
//!   own. The dirty state clears in [`AgentChatView::commit_transcript_save`]
//!   only after the write succeeded, so a failed write retries next save.
