//! Screen-control enforcement, hung off the permission round-trip.
//!
//! The driver runs as its own process that the agent talks to directly, so
//! TREX is not in the tool-dispatch path and cannot gate a call by wrapping
//! it. The one place we are in the path is `can_use_tool`: the agent asks
//! before running a tool, and that ask arrives as
//! [`ThreadEvent::PermissionRequested`]. Everything here hangs off that single
//! interception point — a check placed anywhere else would simply never run.
//!
//! [`ThreadEvent::PermissionRequested`]: trex_agents::thread::ThreadEvent::PermissionRequested
//!
//! ## What this does not cover
//!
//! Only tools from the server *TREX* declares. A user who wires the same
//! driver into their own agent config under a different server name gets tool
//! names this never matches, and no policy at all. That is a real gap and it
//! belongs to the broader safety work, not here — the point of noting it is
//! that the enforcement is scoped to what TREX itself hands the agent.
