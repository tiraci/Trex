//! The mutable half of chat markdown: parser state per message, and code
//! highlighting that arrives when it arrives.
//!
//! [`super::markdown_render`] is pure and knows none of this. It asks a
//! [`CodeHighlights`] whether a fence's colors exist yet and draws plain if they
//! do not — which is the whole reason highlighting is allowed to be slow.
//!
//! ## Why a parser is kept per message
//!
//! A streaming reply is re-rendered on every batch of tokens. Re-reading the
//! whole message each time is quadratic in the length of the reply, and long
//! replies are exactly where that hurts. Keeping the parser alive lets it reuse
//! the blocks it already read and re-read only the tail.
//!
//! ## Why highlighting does not happen here
//!
//! Tokenizing a long fence on the UI thread stalls the frame that asked for it.
//! So a miss returns `None`, the fence draws as plain text at its final size and
//! position, and the work is dispatched to the background executor; the result
//! arrives as a repaint that changes colors and nothing else.
