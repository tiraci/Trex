//! Git changed-files panel — first UI surface consuming the `trex-git`
//! wrappers shipped in Phase 2 steps 1–7. Subscribes to a `StatusPoller`
//! receiver, partitions `GitState::files` into three sections, dispatches
//! file-level stage / unstage / revert actions.
//!
//! Diff view (`OpenDiff`), hunk-level ops, commit dialog, stash UI, and the
//! confirm-dialog for revert all land in later Phase 2 steps. Step 8 is the
//! data-flow skeleton + section rendering only.
//!
//! Runtime: the stage / unstage handlers use `tokio::runtime::Handle::try_current`
//! to spawn into whichever tokio runtime the parent shell entered. If no
//! runtime is entered (e.g. the GPUI smoke test), the handler logs and no-ops
//! instead of panicking. Step 14 wires runtime setup at the shell mount point.
