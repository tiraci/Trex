//! DiffView — read-only patch renderer driven by GitPanel selection.
//!
//! State machine:
//! ```text
//!   Empty                              ← initial
//!   Loading { path, staged }           ← fetch in flight
//!   Ready   { path, staged, diffs, expanded } ← diffs loaded
//!   Failed  { path, staged, error }    ← fetch failed
//! ```
//!
//! Runtime: `load()` uses `tokio::runtime::Handle::try_current()` and falls
//! back to logging + no-op when no tokio runtime is entered. Step 14 wires
//! the runtime at the shell mount point; until then the view stays in
//! `Loading` indefinitely if invoked without a runtime (matches the
//! `spawn_repo_op` pattern in `git_panel/mod.rs:217`).
//!
//! Rendering: `render.rs` owns the pure data plan + the `IntoElement`
//! builder. This file holds state, actions, async wiring, and the root
//! container.
