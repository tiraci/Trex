//! GPUI element construction for the diff viewer.
//!
//! Sibling to `render.rs`. The data plan lives in `render.rs`
//! (`FilePlan`, `HunkPlan`, `LinePlan`, `build_render_plan`); this file
//! turns that plan into a FLAT, virtualization-ready row list
//! (`PreparedRow`) and paints only the visible window via `uniform_list`.
//!
//! ## Why flat + virtualized
//!
//! The earlier renderer emitted one `div` per row for every row of every
//! hunk of every file, plus one nested `div` per syntax token — eagerly,
//! every frame. A few-thousand-line diff became tens of thousands of
//! elements laid out and painted each frame (the lag), and the
//! `overflow_y_scroll` flex column couldn't compute a reliable max scroll
//! offset over that dynamic tree (so it never reached the last line).
//!
//! The fix mirrors how GPUI diff viewers do it:
//!
//!   1. **Flatten** the nested plan into a single `Vec<PreparedRow>` so the
//!      body lives in one flat index space.
//!   2. **Virtualize** with `uniform_list` (fixed `h_row` height) — only the
//!      visible index range is built per frame, and the list owns scrolling
//!      so content height is exact (`rows × h_row`) → scroll reaches the end.
//!   3. **One `StyledText` per line** — syntax + word-diff colors become
//!      `HighlightStyle` ranges over a single shaped run, never a child
//!      element per colored token.
//!
//! ## Continuous flow + foldable context
//!
//! The body reads as one continuous numbered listing — no `@@` marker rows
//! at rest. Each changed line tints inline; the per-region Stage/Discard
//! card reveals on hover, anchored on the region's first changed line. Long
//! runs of unchanged context collapse behind a `ContextFold` expander
//! (3 lines kept on each side of a change; a run longer than the collapse
//! threshold folds its middle). Folding happens at this prepared-row layer
//! only — `change_regions` still anchors over the full diff, so per-region
//! `git add -p` staging is unaffected.
//!
//! Color resolution, gutter strings, and highlight ranges are all baked
//! once into `PreparedRow` (see `prepare`) so the per-frame render closure
//! does no string or highlight work for off-screen rows. The host
//! (`mod.rs`) caches the prepared vec behind an `Rc` and rebuilds it only
//! when the diff, fold, or `expanded` flag changes — never on scroll.
