//! In-memory review-note store for one diff view, plus the markdown
//! formatter that turns accumulated notes into an agent prompt.
//!
//! Pure + GPUI-free: the store is a map keyed by a `(path, line, side)`
//! anchor (the diff scope — `repo` + `diff_ref` — is held by the `DiffView`,
//! not repeated per anchor). The `DiffView` mirrors persisted notes into this
//! store on open and writes changes back through `DiffReviewNoteRepo`; render
//! code reads it to decide which lines get a gutter marker.
//!
//! **A line number is a position, not an identity.** Between the moment a
//! note is written and the moment it is read back, the diff is recomputed —
//! the author edits the file, stages a hunk, the poller reloads. Insert one
//! line above a noted line and every number below it shifts, and a store
//! keyed only by number hands the note to whatever code now occupies that
//! slot. Nothing looks wrong: the marker is in the gutter, the note is in the
//! list, and the prompt sent to an agent quotes code the reviewer never saw
//! and asks it to act on a remark about something else entirely.
//!
//! So each note also carries the text of the line it was written against,
//! and [`ReviewNoteStore::reconcile`] re-runs the question on every load:
//! same text at that number (still anchored), that text found elsewhere in
//! the file (it moved — follow it), or that text gone (the note has outlived
//! its line and must say so rather than point somewhere false). The third
//! case is why detached notes are kept rather than dropped: the remark is
//! still the reviewer's, and losing it silently is its own kind of wrong.
