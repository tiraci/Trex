//! Process-wide handle to the persisted review-note repository.
//!
//! A diff view is constructed deep inside the pane/sidebar tree, far from the
//! single `Db` the app opens at boot. Rather than thread a `DiffReviewNoteRepo`
//! through every intermediate constructor (`ProjectPanes` → `PaneGroup` →
//! tab, and the sidebar tree), the repo handle is installed once at hydrate
//! and read on demand here. This is sound because there is exactly one SQLite
//! database per process — the handle is a genuine singleton, not shared
//! mutable state (`DiffReviewNoteRepo` is a cheap `Clone` newtype over the
//! pooled `Db`).
//!
//! Diff views that boot before the handle is installed (pure unit tests that
//! never call `hydrate`) read `None` and degrade to in-memory-only notes.
