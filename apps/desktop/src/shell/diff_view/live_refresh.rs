//! Deciding whether an open diff is showing something that can still change.
//!
//! A diff tab was a snapshot: it fetched once and then held whatever it got.
//! Everything that edits the files underneath it — the user in another editor,
//! an agent mid-turn, a `git stash` in a terminal — left the tab showing code
//! that had stopped existing, with no cue that it had. The SCM list beside it
//! updated (it rides a 500 ms status poller), which made the stale tab look
//! authoritative rather than old.
//!
//! Refreshing means re-running the same query the tab was opened with, so the
//! only real question is *which* tabs have a query worth re-running. A diff of
//! the working tree does. A diff of a commit does not: it is addressed by a
//! SHA, and re-fetching it every couple of seconds would spend a git process
//! to be told the same thing forever.
//!
//! That decision is here, on its own, because it is a table of claims about
//! what each diff scope is — not something to re-derive inside a timer.
