//! Turning "these pids are listening" into "this project is serving this".
//!
//! The kernel answers about pids. A person thinks about projects. Everything
//! in this file is the join between those two, kept pure so that the rules —
//! which port is shown, whose it is, what happens when two terminals in one
//! project both contain it — are decided by tests rather than by whatever the
//! render pass happened to do.
//!
//! **Why the scan is machine-wide.** It was not, once: it walked only the
//! process trees of terminals this window owns, which meant a dev server
//! started in another terminal app, a database in a container, or a daemon
//! already holding the port a build is about to want were all invisible. A
//! panel that can only see the servers you started *here* cannot tell "nothing
//! is running" apart from "it is running, somewhere else", and those are
//! different answers to the only question a person opens this list to ask.
//! So the socket table is read whole and the rows are *attributed* afterwards.
//!
//! **Three kinds of evidence, in order.** A port is claimed by a project when:
//!
//! 1. its pid is inside the process tree of a terminal this window owns — the
//!    strongest signal there is, because the user demonstrably started it here;
//! 2. failing that, the process's working directory is inside a known project
//!    root — how a server started in an outside terminal is recognised;
//! 3. failing that, the project's path appears as one of the process's
//!    arguments — how `node /work/api/server.js` launched from `/` is caught.
//!
//! Anything left over is *external*: real, listed, actionable to open and copy,
//! but not claimed by a project and never offered a stop button. Attribution
//! evidence is carried on the row rather than discarded, because "why does the
//! panel think this is mine" is a question with a real answer.
//!
//! **Why labels are persisted.** Three `node` rows on 3000, 3001 and 9229 are
//! the API, the docs site and a debugger, and nothing the kernel knows can
//! tell them apart. The name is the user's to write, so it is stored against
//! project+port and comes back when the same server does.
//!
//! One thing here is not pure: [`gather`], the syscall bridge, which reads the
//! socket table and resolves process metadata. It sits beside the rules it
//! feeds rather than in the view, because what it produces is only meaningful
//! against them — but it is the *only* thing in this file that touches the
//! kernel, and it is called from a background thread.
