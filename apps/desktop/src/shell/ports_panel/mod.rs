//! Ports panel — what this machine is currently serving, and which of it is
//! yours.
//!
//! **Why this is a panel and not a log line.** A dev server prints its URL
//! once, at the moment it starts, and then a build log buries it. Ten minutes
//! later "was that 5173 or 5174?" costs a scroll-back, and after a restart on a
//! different port it costs a wrong answer. The socket outlives the line: it
//! exists for exactly as long as the server is accepting connections, so a
//! panel reading the socket table is always current in a way a transcript
//! never is.
//!
//! **Why it lists more than your terminals.** See [`scan`] for the argument
//! and the attribution rules. The short version: the panel's job is to answer
//! "what has 3000", and a list that can only see processes this window started
//! answers a narrower question than the one being asked. Everything is listed;
//! what the panel *claims* is what attribution could justify, and only claimed
//! rows get a destructive action.
//!
//! **Why labels are persisted.** Three `node` rows on 3000, 3001 and 9229 are
//! the API, the docs site and a debugger, and nothing the kernel knows can
//! tell them apart. The name is the user's to write, so it is stored against
//! project+port and comes back when the same server does.
//!
//! The scan itself is driven by [`crate::workspace_root::WorkspaceRoot`] —
//! it owns the terminals and the project list the walk starts from, and the
//! socket read belongs on a background thread. This module renders what the
//! scan produced and owns the actions on a row.
