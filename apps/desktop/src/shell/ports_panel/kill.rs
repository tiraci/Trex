//! Stopping the process behind a port.
//!
//! **Why the panel offers this at all.** "Port 3000 is already in use" is the
//! most common way a dev server fails to start, and the fix is always the
//! same: find what has it, stop that, try again. The finding half is what the
//! rest of this module already does; making the user leave for a terminal to
//! type `kill $(lsof -ti:3000)` is asking them to re-derive by hand a pid the
//! panel is already showing them.
//!
//! **Why only project-attributed rows.** An external row is something this
//! window merely noticed — a system daemon, another app's helper, a container.
//! The panel has no evidence the user meant to be responsible for it, and a
//! stop button next to `ControlCenter` is a footgun with a tooltip. So the
//! action exists only where attribution said "this is yours"; see
//! [`super::scan::PortRow::is_owned`].
//!
//! **Why the pid is re-checked.** A rendered row is up to one poll old, and a
//! pid that exited in that window can have been recycled by something else.
//! Killing on a stale row would then kill an innocent process that happens to
//! have inherited the number. So [`stop_listener`] re-reads the socket table
//! at the moment of the click and refuses unless that pid is *still* listening
//! on *that* port — the same fact the row was claiming, re-established rather
//! than trusted.
//!
//! **Why SIGTERM first.** A dev server asked to stop flushes its build cache,
//! removes its socket file, and lets its own children exit; killed outright it
//! leaves all three behind. The escalation to SIGKILL exists for the process
//! that ignores the polite request, and it happens on a detached timer so the
//! UI thread never waits on it.
