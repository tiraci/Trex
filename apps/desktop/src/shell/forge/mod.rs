//! Forge-provider seam: a thin abstraction over a code-hosting forge's
//! pull-request + CI surface.
//!
//! The `gh`-CLI implementation ([`github_gh::GithubForge`]) is the only one
//! today. The trait exists so a second forge host can slot in later without
//! rewriting the Source Control and Checks call sites — every forge call in
//! the UI goes through [`ForgeProvider`], never the CLI directly.
//!
//! Kept deliberately minimal (YAGNI): one trait, one impl, only the methods
//! the current UI needs. The low-level transport stays in `trex_git::gh`;
//! this layer is the contract the app depends on.
