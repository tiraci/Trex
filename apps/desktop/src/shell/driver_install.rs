//! Shared UI-side state machine for the one-click driver install.
//!
//! Both surfaces that offer the install (the Computer use settings pane and
//! the onboarding wizard) hold the same [`DriverInstallUi`] and drive it the
//! same way: start → poll [`pump`] on a timer → terminal state. The backend
//! enforces one install per process, so when another surface owns the running
//! install this one observes it through the backend's pull-style status
//! instead of a receiver — which is also what makes a closed-and-reopened
//! settings modal show live progress.
