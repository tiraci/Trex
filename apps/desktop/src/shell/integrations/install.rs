//! Running a package manager on the user's behalf, and saying what happened.
//!
//! The shape is deliberately the same as [`crate::shell::driver_install`]: a
//! background thread does the work, the UI holds a small state enum and polls.
//! What is different is what can go wrong. The driver install talks to one
//! known server; this shells out to whatever package manager the machine has,
//! and the interesting failures are the boring ones — needs elevation, package
//! id moved, no network. So the failure state carries the manager's **own**
//! words rather than a category, and the pane always keeps the manual route
//! visible beside the button.
//!
//! One install at a time, per tool. A second click while one is running is a
//! no-op rather than a second process: package managers take a machine-wide
//! lock, and two racing installs produce an error that describes neither.
