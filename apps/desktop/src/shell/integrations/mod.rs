//! Integrations — the external CLIs TREX calls out to, and their health.
//!
//! **Why this exists at all.** Half of TREX's surfaces are wrappers around a
//! command-line tool: Source Control is `git`, the Tasks page is `gh` or
//! `glab`, Search is `rg`. When one of those is absent the surface does not
//! break loudly — it goes quiet. An empty Tasks page looks exactly like a repo
//! with no issues, and a Search panel that finds nothing looks exactly like a
//! search with no matches. The user's conclusion is "this feature is bad",
//! not "this feature is unplugged".
//!
//! So the pane's job is not to list dependencies. It is to convert a silent
//! degradation into a sentence and a button, in the one place a person goes
//! looking when something seems broken.
//!
//! **The remediation is inline for the same reason.** A status page that
//! diagnoses a problem and then tells you to go elsewhere has moved the work
//! without reducing it. The card that says `gh` is missing is the card that
//! installs it, and the card that says it is signed out is the card that tells
//! you the one command that signs it in.
//!
//! Split three ways so the parts can be reasoned about separately:
//!
//! * [`catalog`] — what could be here. Pure data and pure wording.
//! * [`probe`] — what is here. Blocking syscalls, background thread only.
//! * [`install`] — making it be here. A package-manager child process and a
//!   small state machine, in the same shape as the driver install.
//!
//! The view is [`crate::shell::settings_modal::pane_integrations`].
