//! Making a just-installed tool visible to the process that installed it.
//!
//! `winget` installs a CLI and appends its directory to the **persisted** PATH
//! — the one in the registry, which every process started afterwards inherits.
//! This process was started before, so its own PATH still has the old value,
//! and `which` keeps reporting the tool as missing however many times the pane
//! re-probes. Nothing is wrong with the install; the app is simply looking at
//! a stale copy of the answer.
//!
//! Without this, "Install" would work perfectly and then appear not to have,
//! and the fix a user would eventually find is "restart the app" — which is
//! precisely what an inline remediation exists to avoid.
//!
//! Only Windows needs it. Homebrew installs into a prefix that is already on
//! PATH, and so does every Linux package manager: on those platforms a new
//! binary lands somewhere the process is already looking.

/// Re-read the OS's persisted PATH into this process.

/// decide whether a re-probe is worth doing, not to decide whether the install
