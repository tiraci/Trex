//! The one answer to "which agents does this app know about".
//!
//! Two surfaces need that answer and used to compute it separately: the
//! launcher's adapter picker walked the registry and `ACP_PRESETS` inline, and
//! the Agents settings pane carried a hard-coded array of four ids. The second
//! list is why `Custom` and every ACP agent had no environment editor and no
//! profiles, even though `env_for` and `profile_entry_mut` resolve for any
//! adapter id at all.
//!
//! [`agent_catalog`] composes the set once. Each surface still applies its own
//! *display* filter — the launcher hides `Custom` and anything the user
//! disabled, settings hides nothing because settings is where you re-enable it
//! — but neither decides membership any more.
