//! Presence of an agent CLI in a *plain* terminal, read from its process tree.
//!
//! The other two ambient signals are things an agent says. The OSC-9999
//! sideband exists only where TREX installed hooks, which is Claude Code
//! alone; the window title has to be written by the CLI, and several — Codex
//! among them — leave it alone unless the user opts in. Both are also
//! *events*, so they say nothing about an agent sitting idle at its prompt.
//!
//! A process is not a statement. The shell driving a terminal has the agent as
//! a descendant for exactly as long as the agent runs, so walking that tree
//! answers "is an agent here, and which one" for every CLI, working or idle,
//! whether or not it ever announces itself. That makes this the presence
//! signal and leaves the other two to do what they are actually good at:
//! saying what the agent is *doing*.
//!
//! Scanning is throttled to [`SCAN_INTERVAL`] and driven from the terminal's
//! poll tick ahead of its no-output early return, so an idle agent keeps its
//! row and an agent that exits without printing still loses one.
