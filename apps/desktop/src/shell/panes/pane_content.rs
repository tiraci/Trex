//! Pane content variants — terminal split-tree or editor leaf.
//!
//! Carries the per-tab content inside a `PaneGroup`. Terminal tabs can
//! hold MULTIPLE PTYs in a sub-pane split tree (Cmd+D / Cmd+Shift+D);
//! editor tabs are always single. Both expose uniform accessors for
//! focus handle and focused state. PTY-only operations stay reachable
//! via `terminal_active_view()` for ergonomic single-pane access, and
//! via the inner `TerminalSplitTree` for multi-pane iteration.
