//! One answer to "how should GFM markdown be styled", shared by every surface
//! that renders it.
//!
//! # Why this is not a `Default::default()`
//!
//! `TextViewStyle`'s own default is a **light** code highlight theme. That is
//! the wrong answer under a dark palette — code blocks read washed-out — so
//! every markdown surface in the app overrode it. Each did so by pinning
//! `is_dark: true` and `HighlightTheme::default_dark()`, which was correct for
//! exactly as long as the app had one palette.
//!
//! It no longer does. A pinned dark syntax theme under the paper palette is the
//! same defect the pinned light default was under charcoal, in the other
//! direction: dark-theme code colors on a light card. The fix is not another
//! constant but a function of the palette, which is what this is.
//!
//! `is_dark` and `highlight_theme` move together on purpose — `is_dark` sets
//! the renderer's own surface treatment and the highlight theme colors the
//! fences. Splitting them is how a surface ends up half-converted, so the two
//! are decided here in one place and never separately at a call site.
