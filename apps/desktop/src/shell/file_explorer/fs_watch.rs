//! Filesystem watch for the file explorer: the signal that says a directory
//! the panel is showing changed on disk.
//!
//! Before this, `FileExplorer` had exactly two refresh triggers — regaining
//! window focus, and the toolbar's Refresh button. Neither fires for the case
//! that matters most here: an agent or a terminal *inside* the app writing
//! files while the window stays focused the whole time. The tree simply went
//! on showing the directory as it was when it was last expanded, and only a
//! manual refresh corrected it. The git poller is not a substitute — it sees
//! nothing outside git's view, and a folder project has no poller at all.
//!
//! **One recursive watch at the repo root, with `NoCache`.** The recursion is
//! deliberate and so is the cache choice. `notify_debouncer_full`'s default
//! `FileIdMap` builds itself by recursively `stat`-ing every file under each
//! watched root — on a repo with a populated `target/` that is hundreds of
//! thousands of syscalls and seconds of blocking I/O (it is what once froze
//! this app at first paint). `NoCache` does no walk at all: registration is
//! one `FSEventStreamCreate`, and the only thing given up is rename-cookie
//! stitching, which this consumer does not use — a rename reaches us as
//! whatever pair of events the platform emits, and both name a directory to
//! re-read, which is all we ask.
//!
//! Volume is handled by subtraction, not by watching less: a debounced batch
//! is mapped to the set of directories the panel actually has open, and
//! everything else — the whole of `target/`, `.git/` churn, a build touching
//! thousands of files in collapsed subtrees — resolves to nothing.
//!
//! Watching less is not on the table, which is worth saying because a peer
//! tool solves this differently. `notify` never calls
//! `FSEventStreamSetExclusionPaths`, so there is no way to tell the OS not to
//! send us `target/`; the filtering has to happen in this process either way.
//! Measured against a real watcher, that is affordable: 5000 files written
//! under `target/debug/deps` delivered 5008 events in 7 batches and cost
//! 3.3 ms of main-thread work in total — about 0.66 µs an event. The
//! alternative, a non-recursive watch per open directory, would refuse those
//! events at the daemon, but `notify`'s FSEvents backend stops and re-creates
//! its stream (and joins its run-loop thread) on every `watch`/`unwatch`, so
//! it would move the cost onto the main thread on every expand and collapse —
//! a hitch where the user is looking, to save microseconds where they are not.
