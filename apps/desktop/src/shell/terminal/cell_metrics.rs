//! Live cell metrics for the terminal grid.
//!
//! Centralises the `cell_width` / `line_height` math that used to live as
//! magic-number constants (8.4 × 17 px) in the legacy pane host. Measuring per render
//! via `text_system().advance(font_id, font_size, 'm').width` lets the grid
//! adapt when the user changes font or size in Typography, and removes the
//! drift risk where `terminal_view` thought a row was 17 px tall while
//! the host carved cells out of viewport space using a stale constant.
//!
//! Cost: one `resolve_font` + one `advance('m')` per `PaneGroup` render.
//! Both are cached inside GPUI's text system (LRU on `Font`), so steady-
//! state cost is a hash lookup — the standard way GPU terminal pipelines
//! measure the monospace cell advance.
