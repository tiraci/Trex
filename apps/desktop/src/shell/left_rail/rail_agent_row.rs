//! Per-agent rail row + the per-workspace list it composes into.
//!
//! Today the rail shows one collapsed status per workspace. To list every
//! agent under a workspace, the merge step (`session_merge`) produces one
//! `RailAgentRow` per agent — live sessions (from the runtime's
//! `LiveAgentMap`) unified with DB history rows by their shared
//! `agent_sessions.id` UUID. Phase 3's render reads `WorkspaceAgentList`.
