//! LeftRail — full workspace + nav rail.
//!
//! Composition (top → bottom):
//!
//! 1. Nav section: Tasks / Automations / Agents / Search rows. Tasks and
//!    Automations open pane tabs; Agents swaps the rail body; Search is
//!    still a shell.
//! 2. WORKSPACES section header with filter / sort / + controls
//! 3. Workspace list — per-project groups rendering TREX `Workspace`
//!    rows with status dots derived from the latest agent session.
//! 4. Spacer
//! 5. Bottom toolbar: "Add Project" + settings cog
//!
//! Width is `density.w_left_rail` (250px in cockpit density). Full-collapse
//! toggling is handled at `WorkspaceRoot` via the `left_rail_open` flag.
//!
//! Data flow: data is pushed DOWN by `WorkspaceRoot::refresh_left_rail`
//! before each render. LeftRail itself never reads `WorkspaceRoot` —
//! that would re-enter the entity slot during rendering and panic
//! ("cannot read while it is already being updated"). The only thing
//! kept on `weak_root` is dispatch upward via callbacks (e.g.
//! `open_row_menu`), which fire on user events after render completes.
