//! Pure plan helpers for one persisted Workspace's rail row.
//!
//! `build_workspace_row_plan`, `build_workspace_card_plan` and
//! `status_dot_color` are pure functions — no GPUI runtime, no IO — unit-tested
//! without a window. The painter that consumes the plan lives in
//! `workspace_card.rs`; the older single-line row painter that used to sit
//! here had no caller left and was retired.
