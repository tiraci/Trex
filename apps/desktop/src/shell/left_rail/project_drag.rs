//! Drag plumbing for sidebar reorder — payload types, the floating preview
//! chip, and the pure insertion-side helper.
//!
//! The left rail reorders project groups and workspace rows with GPUI's
//! stateless drag idiom: the drag source attaches `.on_drag(payload, …)`,
//! every potential target attaches `.drag_over::<Payload>(…)` to paint an
//! insertion line derived purely from `payload.src_index` vs the target's
//! index, and `.on_drop::<Payload>(…)` computes the destination slot. No
//! shared mutable hover entity — the indicator is a function of the payload
//! and the hovered element alone, so there is no cross-frame state to clear.
