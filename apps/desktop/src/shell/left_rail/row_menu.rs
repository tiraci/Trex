//! Per-workspace-row action menu — small popover anchored under the "…"
//! trigger button. Routes the user's selection back to `WorkspaceRoot`
//! via a `WeakEntity` callback, mirroring the pattern established by the
//! adapter / project pickers.
//!
//! Closed state is `open_for: None`. Open state pins the carried
//! `Workspace`, its [`RowCapabilities`], and a screen-relative `(x, y)`
//! anchor, and renders the popover.
//!
//! **What the menu offers is decided once, by a pure function.** [`menu_actions`]
//! takes the row's capabilities and returns the action list, so the gating is
//! a table of cases testable without a window — and so a primary row, which
//! IS the project's checkout, is asserted never to be offered `Delete`,
//! `Archive`, `Rename`, or `Merge`.
