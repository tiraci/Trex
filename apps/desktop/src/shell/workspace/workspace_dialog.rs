//! Workspace dialog — create + rename modal.
//!
//! `Cmd+Shift+N` opens in `Create` mode; `WorkspaceRoot::request_rename_workspace`
//! opens in `Rename(workspace)` mode. Create mode adds two dropdowns: a
//! project picker (lets the user choose which project to create the
//! workspace under without first activating it via Cmd+O) and an agent
//! picker (auto-spawns the chosen CLI agent in a new tab after the
//! workspace is created; it defaults to the last agent the user chose,
//! and "Skip" leaves the workspace empty).
//!
//! Pattern: full-window overlay (absolute inset-0) for click-outside
//! dismiss; centered modal card. Mirrors the step 5 project picker shape.
