//! Auto-rename from the desktop: the host half of
//! `trex-worktree-ops::auto_rename`.
//!
//! The crate decides *whether* a codename workspace should take the name of
//! its work and *to what*; this decides *when*, which is "after the user has
//! seen it and said yes". The signal is a chat's generated task summary,
//! routed here as [`OfferWorkspaceAutoRename`](crate::actions::OfferWorkspaceAutoRename)
//! from the pane group. The offer is a toast with `Rename` / `Keep`; a
//! timeout keeps. Nothing here ever shows a failure — the user did not ask
//! for a rename, and a refused optimisation is a debug line, not an error.
//!
//! The one exception is a rollback that itself failed, which is not a failed
//! optimisation but a repository a human has to repair by hand; that is
//! toasted exactly as the manual rename toasts it.
