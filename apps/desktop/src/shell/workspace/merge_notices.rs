//! The pointer to a stash a merge left on the stack.
//!
//! When `merge_branch` auto-stashes a dirty project root and then either
//! conflicts or fails to pop, the user's uncommitted work is sitting in the
//! stash stack and **nothing else in the app says so**. A toast is not good
//! enough: a dismissed toast loses the only pointer to that work, which makes
//! any code path where `auto_stash` is `Some` and it reaches only a toast a
//! release-blocking bug rather than a polish item.
//!
//! So the pointer is persisted here until the user acts on it.
//!
//! **Two deliberate choices:**
//!
//! 1. **Not on the workspace row.** The row's only free-text column is
//!    `comment`, and `WorktreeProgressWire` rides the *coordination* read gate
//!    precisely because it carries "only an id and agent-authored text, never
//!    the host paths and branch names". A repository path and a branch name in
//!    `comment` would push exactly that across a gate designed to withhold it.
//!    This store is the desktop's own settings DB, which no remote peer reads.
//!
//! 2. **The stash is remembered by MESSAGE, never by index.** `StashRef.index`
//!    "is only stable while no other process mutates the stash stack", and a
//!    recovery notice is precisely a long suspension: the user resolves
//!    conflicts for an hour and stashes twice in their own terminal, and
//!    `stash@{0}` now names something else. A stored `stash@{N}` that has since
//!    renumbered is *worse* than no pointer, because it pops the wrong entry
//!    confidently. [`resolve`] re-reads `stash_list` at the moment of recovery
//!    and matches on the message.
