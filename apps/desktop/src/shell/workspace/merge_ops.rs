//! The `Merge into <default>` row action: pre-flight, dispatch, and what the
//! outcome means on screen.
//!
//! Two halves, split so the interesting one is testable without a window:
//!
//! - [`report_for`] and the peeling below are pure. They turn a
//!   [`MergeOutcome`] into what the user is told, and they are where the
//!   nesting trap lives.
//! - The `WorkspaceRoot` methods are the GPUI half: they read holders on the
//!   main thread, run the two-phase merge on the executor, and route the result.
//!
//! **`MergeOutcome::AutoStashed` wraps another variant rather than sitting
//! beside it.** A dirty project root plus an already-merged branch is
//! `AutoStashed { inner: AlreadyUpToDate }`, so a flat five-arm match reports
//! "merged" for a merge that did nothing. Everything here peels first and maps
//! second; the real shape is a cross-product of {stash present, pop failed} ×
//! {FastForward, Merged, AlreadyUpToDate, Conflicted}.
