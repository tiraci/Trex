//! Keeping the rail's active workspace in step with what the user is looking at.
//!
//! The rail's selection has two sources that can disagree. A click on a rail
//! row sets it deliberately and, by design, does NOT switch tabs ("selection
//! set, spawn deferred"). Everything else — focusing a tab, clicking a card on
//! the agents dashboard — moves what is on screen without touching the rail.
//! This module reconciles the two: the selection follows focus when focus
//! moves, and a deliberate selection survives until it does.

///    the caller leave its baseline untouched and retry. The rail's rows are
///    filled by a background pass, so an early refresh can see the right
///    worktree and no rows yet — adopting the baseline there would mark the
