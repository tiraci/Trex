//! Remote-control pane — one master switch that exposes running agent sessions to
//! the TREX mobile app and, while on, binds the in-app iroh host so a phone can
//! pair. The toggle flips the shared [`RemoteControl`] global's `enabled` flag and
//! starts/stops the host: enabling binds an endpoint off-thread (on the tokio
//! runtime) and publishes a `PairingTicket` back here; disabling stops the host and
//! stops advertising.
//!
//! **Pairing is its own act, not a side effect of binding.** The pane at rest holds
//! no live code; "Pair a device" opens a sub-view, and opening that view is what
//! mints the one-time secret it renders as a scannable QR (see
//! [`pairing_qr`](super::pairing_qr)). Leaving the view — or closing the modal —
//! retires the secret again.
//!
//! That split is what lets a second device pair without disturbing the first. The
//! endpoint id is pinned to the durable host identity and the secret is just a
//! value in the live `AuthStore`, so a new code costs a mutex rather than a
//! rebind. Opening a window from the toggle instead (the shape this replaced)
//! meant the only way to reach a fresh code was to toggle off and on, which
//! closes the endpoint under every device already connected through it.
//!
//! The switch itself is persisted (`ENABLED_SETTING`), so a desktop that had
//! remote access on comes back up serving it — otherwise a paired phone would
//! silently fail to reach a restarted Mac. The pairing window is deliberately not
//! persisted: a relaunch resumes the host with no slot open, so already-paired
//! devices reconnect (they authenticate by key against the durable device store)
//! while no new device can claim this Mac unasked. The handshake secret is never
//! displayed or logged.
