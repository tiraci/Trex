//! Settings modal — minimal panes wiring settings that already round-trip
//! to disk (terminal + AI commit-message), plus read-only reference panes
//! (keybindings, appearance, about). Opened via the left-rail cog or
//! `Cmd+,`. Mirrors the `project_picker` modal pattern: open/close +
//! click-outside dismiss + `track_focus` for keyboard handling.
//!
//! Editable panes apply immediately — each control mutates a working copy
//! and writes the TOML; the existing file watcher reloads + repaints. The
//! modal never sets the global itself (that would race the debouncer).
//! Rendering lives in [`view`]; this file owns state + persistence.
