//! Computer use on Windows: approving a driver that nobody signed.
//!
//! The macOS pane next door asks "is the driver installed and does it pass the
//! signature gate?", and the answer arrives from Apple. Windows has no such
//! answer to fetch — every published `cua-driver.exe` is `NotSigned` — so
//! `trex_computer_use::trust` moves the decision to the person who can
//! actually make it, and this pane is where they make it.
//!
//! # What the screen has to show, and why each piece is load-bearing
//!
//! There is no separate confirmation dialog. Everything the decision rests on
//! is on the pane *before* the button is clicked, because a modal that appears
//! after the click would be the second thing the user reads rather than the
//! first, and this is the one approval in the product with nothing behind it
//! but the user's own care:
//!
//! - **The path**, because approving the wrong file is the failure mode this
//!   cannot otherwise detect.
//! - **The size and the full 64-character digest**, ungrouped and untruncated,
//!   so it can be compared against upstream's published `checksums.txt`. An
//!   abbreviated hash is decoration — it cannot be checked against anything.
//! - **The words "unverified publisher"**, prominently, because every other
//!   trust surface in this app means "someone vouched for this" and this one
//!   does not.
//!
//! # What approval does and does not mean
//!
//! It pins the bytes. It does not establish identity: nothing here can tell an
//! authentic driver from a hostile one the user was talked into installing.
//! What it buys is continuity — those bytes cannot change again without being
//! asked — which is the realistic threat against a long-lived install of an
//! unsigned, self-updating tool.
//!
//! Re-approval is the routine path rather than an edge case: upstream ships
//! roughly six releases a week and the driver rewrites itself in place. The
//! pane makes that one click. It deliberately does not make it zero.
//!
//! # Installing from here
//!
//! TREX can also fetch the driver itself (`trex_computer_use::install`),
//! and that changes nothing above. The download is checked against the
//! checksum upstream publishes beside it, which is corruption cover and not a
//! signature — the file still arrives unsigned, and the approval it asks for
//! is the same decision, made about bytes that have not been placed yet.
