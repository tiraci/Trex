///   actionable rows are the visual focus. Counts ride inline in the label
///   (`Push (1)`, `Sync (↓0 ↑1)`) from the resolver.
/// - **Disabled** verbs recede to `fg_muted`; the "why not" rides a hover
///   **tooltip** rather than crowding every row. The two review verbs (Create
///   PR / Push before PR) are the exception — their path-to-enable isn't
///   obvious from the label, so the reason also shows as an inline `fg_subtle`
///   sub-line.
