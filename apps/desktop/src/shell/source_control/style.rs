//! Source Control panel style tokens, resolved from the user's appearance.
//!
//! The Source Control surface intentionally runs a touch looser than the
//! global cockpit density: 12px horizontal padding instead of 8, 12px body
//! text instead of 11. That intent is preserved here — but as a *ratio* to a
//! [`Density`] / [`Typography`] token rather than a literal, so the panel
//! follows both appearance controls instead of standing still while the rest
//! of the cockpit moves.
//!
//! # Why a resolved struct and not `const`
//!
//! These were bare constants until a live pass at 120% zoom caught the
//! consequence: every other surface grew and the SCM panel did not, so its
//! 12px rows sat inside chrome sized for 18px type. A helper that took a
//! `Density` and ignored it stood in for the conversion; this is the
//! conversion.
//!
//! Everything moves together on purpose. Scaling the padding alone would grow
//! the panel's horizontal air at 150% while row heights stayed put, which
//! reads worse than a panel that is uniformly unscaled — so the whole module
//! converts in one step or not at all.
//!
//! # Deriving, not re-listing
//!
//! Each field below names the token it comes from. Two rules decide which:
//!
//! * A value with a real scale to belong to — a type size, a padding, a row
//!   height — takes the token, so it follows *both* the density preset and
//!   the zoom.
//! * A value that is just how big a thing is — a 14px glyph, a 2px gap inside
//!   an icon cluster — passes through [`Density::scale`], which applies the
//!   zoom but deliberately not the preset. See that method for why inventing
//!   a token nobody else shares would be worse.
