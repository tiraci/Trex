//! Source Control dropdown menu — pure data resolver.
//!
//! Computes the dropdown menu rows (kind + label + tooltip + disabled
//! state) from a single inputs snapshot. No GPUI imports — every
//! input/output is plain data so the whole module is unit-testable from
//! `cargo test --workspace` without a TestAppContext.
//!
//! Mirrors the state machine in `primary_action.rs` but emits the full
//! menu rather than collapsing to a single verb. Stable row order keeps
//! the menu shape consistent across releases so the user's muscle memory
//! doesn't change post-upgrade.
