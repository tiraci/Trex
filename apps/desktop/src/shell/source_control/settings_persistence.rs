//! SQLite-backed per-worktree settings persistence helpers for the
//! Source Control panel.
//!
//! Free functions only — no `impl SourceControlPanel` here. The panel
//! call sites (`new` for load, `set_base_ref` for save) hold the
//! `WorktreeSettingsRepo` clone themselves and pass it in. This keeps
//! the panel struct unaware of the persistence layer's failure modes:
//! a missing repo, a missing row, a SQLite hiccup, and a stale
//! `updated_at` all collapse into `Option<String>` or
//! `Result<(), StorageError>` at this boundary.
//!
//! Both functions log at warn but never raise — base-ref persistence is
//! a UX nicety, not a panel invariant. Restart will reset to the repo
//! default rather than wedge the panel.
