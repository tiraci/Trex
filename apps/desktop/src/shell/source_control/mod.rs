//! Source Control tab body — replaces the bare `GitPanel + DiffView` mount
//! inside `RightSidebar`. Composes:
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌── scope tabs (All | Uncommitted) ────┐
//! ├── branch chip (branch • ↑A ↓B • N) ──┤
//! ├── filter input ──────────────────────┤
//! ├── commit area (prefix subj body btn) ┤
//! ├── files list (GitPanel)              ┤
//! ├── diff view (DiffView)               ┤
//! ├── commit graph (scope=All)           ┤
//! └──────────────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! All children stay always-mounted — avoids IPC storms when the user
//! flips between scope tabs or quickly switches workspaces. Filter /
