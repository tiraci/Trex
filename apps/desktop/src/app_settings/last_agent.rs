//! The create dialog's Agent default: the last agent the user chose.

//! A UX preference in the global `SettingsRepo` key/value store, following
//! `scm_layout_settings`'s reasoning — it belongs to the person at this
//! keyboard, not to a repository or a team, so it is not `git.toml` state.
//!
//! Written on every successful create, read when the dialog opens. The
//! resolution is total: last used (a remembered `Skip` included) → the
//! launch settings' default agent → the first adapter in the dialog's order
//! → `Skip`. `Skip` as a *fallback* is right; `Skip` as the *default* is what
//! made "open a project, create a workspace, start an agent" three steps.
