//! App-side loader and writer for `appearance.toml` — the palette, the density
//! preset, the whole-UI zoom, and the two font families.
//!
//! The first three are the [`Appearance`] global; the faces are a
//! [`FontChoice`] beside it, because they cannot live in a `Copy` stamp (see
//! [`trex_settings::fonts`]). This module owns the file both are written to;
//! `font_settings` owns the half that needs a text system to validate.
//!
//! Startup reads `appearance.toml` from the app data dir (seeding a default so
//! the file is there to look at), sanitizes it, and installs it as a GPUI
//! global. Every view then resolves its own tokens from that global on render
//! — see [`trex_settings::appearance::sync`] for why the refresh is a pull
//! rather than a push.
//!
//! # No file watch, unlike `terminal.toml`
//!
//! The terminal settings are file-only, so a watcher is the *only* way an edit
//! can reach the app. Appearance has controls in the Settings modal, which
//! makes the app the writer — and a debounced watch between a click and its
//! effect would put a quarter-second of lag on a control whose entire job is
//! immediate visual feedback. So [`set`] writes the global first and the file
//! second. The cost is that hand-editing `appearance.toml` needs a relaunch,
//! which is the right trade for the surface that has a UI.
