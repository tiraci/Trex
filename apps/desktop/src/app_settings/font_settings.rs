//! The half of the appearance settings that needs a text system: which font
//! families this machine actually has, and whether the ones a person picked are
//! among them.
//!
//! [`trex_settings::fonts`] holds the choice and resolves it to a family
//! name. It deliberately stops there — gpui looks a family up verbatim and does
//! not fall back to anything a person chose, so a name that is not installed
//! has to be caught *before* it reaches `Typography`, and only
//! `TextSystem::all_font_names` can say. That check lives here, next to the
//! enumeration that feeds the picker.
//!
//! # What a bad name costs, and why this is not paranoia
//!
//! `TextSystem::resolve_font` never fails: a missing primary walks a hardcoded
//! stack inside gpui and lands on the `.ZedMono` sentinel. So an uninstalled
//! face does not error, it silently redraws the terminal grid in a typeface
//! nobody chose. The two ways to arrive there are ordinary — a settings file
//! carried between machines, and a font uninstalled after it was picked — which
//! is why the validation runs on every load rather than only on the way in.
