//! App-level settings modules.
//!
//! These are the *host* crate's own settings surfaces (terminal, motion, SCM
//! layout, keybindings, commit-message AI, agent launch defaults) — distinct
//! from the workspace-wide `trex-settings` crate, which owns the on-disk
//! settings store. Grouped here purely for traversal; each submodule is
//! re-exported at the crate root so existing `crate::terminal_settings::…`
//! paths keep resolving.
