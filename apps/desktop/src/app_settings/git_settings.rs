//! App-side loader + persistence for [`GitSettings`], plus the cached git
//! username the branch-name previews resolve against.
//!
//! **What is cached is the username, not the answer.** An earlier shape cached
//! the *resolved prefix*, which meant the settings pane's own preview could not
//! reflect the control the user was operating: the working copy changed on
//! every keystroke while the preview read a global that only a completed async
//! re-resolution would move. Caching the one genuinely expensive input instead
//! — `git config user.name`, a subprocess, occasionally repo-scoped — lets
//! every caller run the real resolver
//! ([`resolve_prefix_with`](trex_worktree_ops::branch_name::resolve_prefix_with))
//! synchronously, against whichever settings it means: the pane against its
//! unsaved working copy, everyone else against the saved global.
//!
//! That is what makes "the preview and the branch actually created agree" a
//! property of the code. There is one resolver and one cached input; two
//! callers holding the same settings cannot compute different names.
