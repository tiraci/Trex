//! App-side installer for the [`Motion`] global (animation durations +
//! reduced-motion gate).
//!
//! The reduced-motion preference is resolved **once at startup** and installed
//! as the [`Motion`] global, so every animated surface reads one source of
//! truth (see `trex_settings::motion`). Reading once per launch matches how
//! the OS exposes its own "reduce motion" accessibility flag — it isn't a
//! live-tunable knob like the terminal render settings, so this needs neither a
//! toml file nor a file-watch.
//!
//! Source of the flag today: the `trex_REDUCE_MOTION` env var (`1`/`true`/
//! `yes`/`on` ⇒ reduced). This is the seam a future OS-preference query
//! (macOS `accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion`) or a settings toggle would
//! plug into — call sites never change because they read the resolved global.
