//! Keeps the menu-bar indicator honest about what agents are driving.
//!
//! # Why this polls rather than being told
//!
//! Grants are not created in one place. TREX records one when the user
//! approves a consent card — but the `PreToolUse` hook is a separate short-lived
//! process, and it resolves build provenance itself, so an agent driving a
//! binary it just built gets a grant this process never sees. Anything wired to
//! the approval path would therefore go dark for the single most common case
//! the feature has.
//!
//! The grant table is the one thing both writers share, so it is what gets read.
//!
//! # What idle costs
//!
//! Screen control is off by default and stays off for most users forever, so the
//! idle path has to be genuinely free. It is one `metadata()` call per tick: if
//! the grants file has not changed and nothing is on screen, the tick ends
//! there — no lock, no parse, no pid resolution.
//!
//! The full read only runs when the file changed or the indicator is already
//! showing. That second condition matters: a granted process can exit without
//! touching the file, and the indicator has to stop naming an app that is gone.

/// input method's candidate window, leaving a dialog, and vim, everywhere.
///
/// # Why a held grant is not the signal
///
/// The obvious reading of "is an agent driving" is "does an agent hold a grant",
/// and it is wrong by a wide margin. A grant is *consent*, and consent is
/// answered once per chat so the user is not asked again every turn — so a chat
/// that clicked once at breakfast still holds its grant at lunch. Keyed on that,
/// this tap is armed for exactly the "potentially hours" the paragraph above
/// rejects, and the menu bar spends those hours claiming apps are being driven
/// while the machine sits idle.
///
/// So the tap follows a separate, turn-scoped mark: set by the hook when a call
/// is actually allowed, cleared at the turn boundary. The user loses Escape
/// while an agent is driving, and gets it back when the turn ends.
///
/// # The gap that costs
///
/// Arming happens on the tick that first *sees* the mark, so up to [`TICK`]
/// passes between an agent's first allowed call and Escape being able to stop
/// it. Closing it would mean arming on "an agent could drive" rather than "an
/// agent is driving" — which is the always-on tap above, and a worse trade.
