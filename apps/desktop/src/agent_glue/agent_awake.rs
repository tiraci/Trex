//! Ref-counted prevent-idle-sleep assertion, held for three independent reasons.
//!
//! **Agents:** each agent-tab status watcher acquires an [`AwakeHold`] when its
//! agent enters `Running` and drops it on the way out (or when the tab closes —
//! RAII makes the release unconditional), so an overnight run keeps the machine
//! from idle-sleeping while costing nothing once everything is parked.
//!
//! **Remote access:** the host holds one for as long as it is bound. A phone can
//! only reach a machine that is awake, so without it remote control quietly
//! stops working a few minutes after the user walks away — the failure it exists
//! to prevent looks exactly like the feature being broken.
//!
//! **Scheduling:** a schedule armed to fire later holds one until it does. Note
//! this only prevents *idle sleep while the app is running* — it cannot wake a
//! sleeping machine or relaunch a quit app, so an overnight schedule still needs
//! the app left open.
//!
//! Each reason has its own user toggle (Notifications → "Keep this computer
//! awake while agents run", Remote → "Keep this computer awake while on"), and
//! they are tracked separately so neither setting silently governs the other.
//! Flipping one takes effect immediately on a live assertion in either
//! direction, while keeping the hold count — so re-enabling mid-run re-asserts.
//!
//! The process-global [`AgentAwake`] creates **one** OS assertion when the
//! first reason wants it and releases it when none do; the OS refcounts nothing
//! for us, so a second assertion would only be another thing to leak.
//!
//! Both shipping platforms have a real hold behind [`SleepAssertionBackend`] —
//! an IOKit assertion on macOS, a power request on Windows — so the toggles mean
//! the same thing on each. The seam also keeps the refcount/toggle logic
//! unit-testable without touching power management.
