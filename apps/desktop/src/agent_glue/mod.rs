//! Agent glue — the host-side wiring that keeps live agents coherent.
//!
//! What is still *here* is what needs the app: `agent_awake` (sleep-assertion
//! and App-Nap suppression while agents run) and `screen_control_watch`.
//!
//! The status-hook half moved to the `trex-agent-hooks` crate, because the
//! CLI has to install and inspect the same hooks the app does and a verb that
//! only worked while the GUI was up would be useless exactly when it is
//! reached for. It is re-exported below under its historical names, so every
//! `crate::agent_hook_dialects::…` / `trex_app::agent_status_hooks::…` call
//! site resolves unchanged.
