//! macOS application menu.
//!
//! Without an installed main menu, macOS titles the bold application menu
//! from the launching process, so a dev build surfaces under the wrong name.
//! Installing a menu whose first entry is named "TREX" fixes the menu bar
//! and gives the standard macOS items (About / Hide / Quit / Window) their
//! conventional shape and keyboard shortcuts.
//!
//! Menu-item shortcuts are derived by GPUI from the keymap binding for each
//! action, so [`key_bindings`] must be installed alongside [`app_menus`] for
//! ⌘Q / ⌘H / ⌘M to display. The native items (About, Hide, Minimize, …) are
//! dispatched as GPUI actions and handled in `main.rs`, which calls into the
//! [`platform`] helpers below to invoke the AppKit responder selectors.

// in `main.rs`; the Edit entries are driven by the OS via their `OsAction`
// selector, so those units only satisfy the menu API.
//
// `About` is gone from this list on purpose. It used to open AppKit's standard
// About panel; it now dispatches `actions::OpenAbout`, the same action the
// Windows menu and the palette use, so both platforms land on the one pane
// that can answer "is there a newer version" as well as "what am I running".
