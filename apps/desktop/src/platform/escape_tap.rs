//! A global Escape key that stops an agent driving the screen — and does not
//! reach the app being driven.
//!
//! # Why a `CGEventTap` and not a global monitor
//!
//! `NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:` is observe-only by Apple's
//! design; it physically cannot swallow an event. Built on that, Escape would
//! fire the abort **and still reach the frontmost, agent-controlled app** —
//! leaving open the exact hole this closes: an agent that puts a dialog on
//! screen would have the user's panic key dismissing its own dialog.
//!
//! A `CGEventTap` created with `kCGEventTapOptionDefault` is *active*: the
//! callback's return value decides whether the event continues. Returning null
//! consumes it.
//!
//! # Live only while an agent is driving
//!
//! The tap swallows **every** Escape on the machine while it is armed, so it is
//! armed only for the duration of a screen-control session and torn down the
//! moment the last one ends. A tap left armed would break Escape in every app
//! the user owns, including dismissing an input method's candidate window.
//! [`arm`] returning a guard rather than installing something permanent is what
//! makes that hard to get wrong.
//!
//! # Two ways it can fail, both reported rather than hidden
//!
//! Creating this tap needs **Input Monitoring**, which is a different switch
//! from Accessibility and the one usually missing: macOS gates keyboard taps on
//! it, so a build that already holds Accessibility still fails here. Without it
//! `CGEventTapCreate` returns null, [`arm`] fails, and the caller must say so —
//! a UI claiming Escape will stop an agent when it will not is worse than one
//! that admits it cannot.
//!
//! The null says nothing about *which* switch it wanted, so anything shown to
//! the user has to name both rather than pick one. Naming Accessibility alone
//! sends someone who has already granted it back to a pane that is correct,
//! where they will find nothing to change and conclude the feature is broken.
//!
//! macOS also *disables* a tap whose callback is too slow
//! (`kCGEventTapDisabledByTimeout`). That arrives as a callback of its own and
//! must be answered by re-enabling, or the tap goes quiet and stays quiet. It
//! is the classic way this API fails in the field, which is why the callback
//! does nothing but set a flag and post a wake-up.
//!
//! # A third way, which this module cannot see for itself
//!
//! While any process holds **secure event input** — a password field, the lock
//! screen, some terminals — macOS delivers no keyboard events to any tap at
//! all. That is the feature working as designed; it is what stops a keylogger.
//!
//! It is invisible from this side: `CGEventTapCreate` succeeds, [`arm`] returns
//! a guard, and `CGEventTapIsEnabled` reports true. Escape simply never
//! arrives. So **a successful [`arm`] is not proof that Escape can stop an
//! agent**, and a UI built on that assumption makes exactly the promise this
//! module's premise says must not be made.
//!
//! Nothing here can detect it, because the tap is not where the answer lives.
//! [`crate::platform::secure_input`] reads it out of the IORegistry, and
//! callers must ask *both* before claiming the kill switch works.
//!
//! # Windows: a different API with the same property, and the same caveat
//!
//! `docs/windows-port-exclusions.md` listed this feature as having no Windows
//! equivalent. That is wrong, and the reason matters: the requirement is not
//! "a global hotkey" but **consume, don't observe**, and Windows has exactly
//! one API that qualifies.
//!
//! A `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook installed with `SetWindowsHookExW` sees every key
//! before the focused application does, and returning non-zero *without*
//! calling `CallNextHookEx` swallows it. That is the same active/passive
//! distinction as `kCGEventTapOptionDefault` versus a global monitor, and it is
//! the whole reason this module exists rather than using `RegisterHotKey` —
//! which would also work, and would also let the key through.
//!
//! Two things are *better* than on macOS: no permission is required, so
//! [`EscapeTapError::NotPermitted`] cannot occur, and there is no
//! Input-Monitoring pane to send anyone to.
//!
//! Three constraints carry over almost unchanged:
//!
//! - **A message pump is required** on the installing thread. The system
//!   delivers low-level hook callbacks by posting to that thread's queue, so a
//!   hook armed on a thread that never pumps is a hook that never fires. GPUI's
//!   main thread pumps, which is where [`arm`] already had to be called.
//! - **A slow callback is silently unhooked.** Windows drops a low-level hook
//!   that exceeds `LowLevelHooksTimeout` (default 300 ms) — the direct analogue
//!   of `kCGEventTapDisabledByTimeout`, and worse, because there is no
//!   notification to answer. The same answer applies and matters more: the
//!   callback sets an atomic and returns, and does nothing else, ever.
//! - **A successful [`arm`] is still not proof Escape can stop an agent.** The
//!   causes differ but the conclusion does not. The hook does not run on the
//!   secure desktop (UAC consent, Ctrl+Alt+Del, the lock screen), and UIPI
//!   stops an unelevated TREX from intercepting keys headed for a
//!   higher-integrity foreground window. `SetWindowsHookExW` succeeds in both
//!   cases and Escape simply never arrives.
//!
//! That last point has no [`crate::platform::secure_input`] counterpart to
//! consult: there is no equivalent of reading `IOConsoleUsers` to find out. So
//! on Windows the honest answer to "does the kill switch work right now" is
//! *cannot confirm*, and any UI must not upgrade that to *yes*.
