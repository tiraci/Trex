//! Single-instance guard for the GUI process.
//!
//! Two TREX GUI processes pointed at the same on-disk data directory race on
//! the per-window layout store (`terminal_tabs:*`, `pane_relay_ids`,
//! `open_windows`) and both attach the same relay PTYs, so the second launch
//! silently clobbers the first's persisted session — a terminal saved by one
//! instance vanishes when the other overwrites the snapshot. This guard makes a
//! second launch a no-op: it takes an exclusive advisory lock on a file in the
//! data directory and, if a live instance already holds it, brings that
//! instance to the foreground and bows out instead of booting a second racing
//! window set.
//!
//! The lock mechanics live in [`trex_single_instance`], shared with the
//! headless host's own role locks; what stays here is the GUI-only half —
//! which file names the GUI role, and how a contender raises the holder's
//! window on each platform. The companion only short-circuits the GUI boot
//! path; the `notify` / `agent-status` helper CLIs and the dev spikes run
//! before this check, so they never contend with a live window.
