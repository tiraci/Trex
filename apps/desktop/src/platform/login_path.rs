//! Give a GUI-launched app the `PATH` its owner actually has.
//!
//! # The failure this exists to stop
//!
//! Agent backends are spawned by bare name — `Command::new("claude")`,
//! `Command::new("codex")` — and so is the `which` that detects which ones are
//! installed. That resolves through the inherited `PATH`, and what a process
//! inherits depends entirely on how it was started. A shell launch inherits the
//! `PATH` the user's login and `rc` files built; a Finder, Dock, Spotlight, or
//! desktop-launcher launch inherits whatever stub the session manager hands
//! out, and nothing else.
//!
//! Every agent CLI installs outside that stub — `~/.local/bin`, Homebrew, a
//! Node version manager. So a double-clicked TREX lists every agent as "not
//! installed", and starting one reports "Failed to start agent: spawn agent
//! process" with no hint that the cause is an environment variable.
//!
//! It hides well. Terminals keep working, because those are spawned through the
//! relay's login shell and pick the real `PATH` up on the way. Only the agent
//! path breaks — and never for a developer, who runs the binary from a shell
//! that already has it.
//!
//! # Why the whole process, rather than each spawn site
//!
//! Setting it once here fixes every present and future `Command::new`, and the
//! detection pass that decides which agents to offer. Threading an environment
//! through each call site would leave the next one to be written broken again,
//! and the symptom is far enough from the cause that it would not be noticed.
//!
//! # The three ways this module was itself wrong
//!
//! The first two were measured on 2026-09-19 against an installed 0.1.21 on
//! macOS 15.6, which listed all seven agents as "not installed" while every one
//! of them ran in the user's terminal. `ps eww` on the running app is what
//! settled it, and is the way to settle it again.
//!
//! 1. **The launch test compared `PATH` against launchd's stub as one exact
//!    string.** launchd hands a GUI app
//!    `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin` — five entries, not the
//!    four in `<paths.h>`'s `_PATH_STDPATH`, which this module had hard-coded.
//!    The string never matched, so adoption never ran at all. The lesson is not
//!    "add `/usr/local/bin`": it is that a guard keyed to a string the OS owns
//!    will go stale again. See [`started_from_a_shell`].
//! 2. **The shell was run non-interactive.** For `zsh` that skips `~/.zshrc`,
//!    which is where `nvm`, `bun`, `pnpm`, and most CLI installers write their
//!    `PATH` line — so three of seven agents stayed invisible even once
//!    adoption ran. See [`probes`].
//! 3. **It was `#[cfg(unix)]`, and split `PATH` on `:`.** The gap is not
//!    macOS-only: a Linux desktop launcher hands out a systemd stub the same
//!    way, and on Windows a `PATH` the user's PowerShell profile extends is
//!    invisible to a process Explorer started. Everything here is now written
//!    against [`std::env::split_paths`] and a per-platform [`probes`] list.
