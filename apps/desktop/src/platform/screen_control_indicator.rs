//! The menu-bar dot that appears while an agent can drive the screen.
//!
//! # Why the menu bar and not a panel in the window
//!
//! The one moment this indicator has to work is the moment TREX is *not* what
//! the user is looking at — an agent driving Safari means Safari is frontmost.
//! Anything drawn inside our own window is invisible exactly then, which makes
//! it an indicator for the case that did not need one.
//!
//! The menu bar is the cheapest surface that is visible over another app's
//! full-screen window, and it is where macOS itself puts its screen-recording
//! and microphone indicators — so it reads as a system-level signal rather than
//! as one app's chrome, which is the right register for this.
//!
//! # What it deliberately is not
//!
//! No state machine, no ticker of its own, no click handling. It is a mirror:
//! the caller hands it the current [`Driving`] and it makes the menu bar match.
//! [`update`](ScreenControlIndicator::update) is idempotent and cheap enough to
//! call on every poll, so nothing has to track whether it is already showing.
//!
//! The menu's rows are informational and therefore disabled — deliberately.
//! Stopping an agent is Escape's job, and a clickable "Stop" here would be a
//! second, slower path to the same thing that only works when the user can find
//! the mouse.
