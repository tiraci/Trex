//! Relaunching the app after it quits, for "restart to update".
//!
//! # Why a detached shell instead of just spawning ourselves
//!
//! Two constraints have to hold at once. The staged update is swapped in
//! during the quit path, so the relaunch must happen *after* this process is
//! gone or it would launch the old bundle. And the single-instance guard
//! (`platform::single_instance`) holds a `flock` for the process's lifetime —
//! a new instance started too early sees `AlreadyRunning`, foregrounds the
//! dying process, and exits, leaving the user with nothing.
//!
//! Both are satisfied by waiting for the old pid to disappear: the kernel
//! releases the flock on exit, so the moment the pid is gone the lock is free.
//! A tiny `sh` in its own session outlives us to do that waiting.
//!
//! The wait is bounded. A wedged quit must not strand an immortal sleeper
//! polling forever; on timeout the helper exits without launching, and the
//! user relaunches by hand — into the new version, since the swap either
//! already happened or will on the next clean quit.
//!
//! Windows needs the same helper for the same two reasons, and needs it more
//! literally: its swap renames `TREX.exe` itself, so a relaunch that raced
//! the quit would start a file that is halfway to being replaced. See
//! [`windows`] below.
