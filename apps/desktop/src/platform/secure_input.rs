//! Whether macOS is currently withholding keyboard events from every event tap.
//!
//! While any process holds **secure event input** — a password field, the lock
//! screen, some terminals — the window server stops delivering key events to
//! taps. That is the feature working correctly: it is what stops a keylogger
//! reading a password out of another app.
//!
//! # Why this has to be asked rather than inferred
//!
//! It is invisible from the tap's own side. `CGEventTapCreate` succeeds,
//! `CGEventTapEnable` succeeds, and `CGEventTapIsEnabled` reports true. The
//! keys simply never arrive. So a screen-control kill switch built on a tap
//! cannot tell from the tap whether it works, and "Press Esc to stop" is a
//! promise it would go on making while being unable to keep it.
//!
//! The state lives in the IORegistry, on the `IOConsoleUsers` property: a
//! non-zero `kCGSSessionSecureInputPID` names the process holding it. The same
//! answer by hand:
//!
//! ```text
//! ioreg -l -d 1 -k IOConsoleUsers | grep kCGSSessionSecureInputPID
//! ```

/// Is anything holding secure input right now?
///
/// The question callers actually have. Answering it costs an IORegistry search,
/// which measures well under a millisecond — cheap enough to ask on every tick,
/// which it has to be, because a password field can take focus at any moment.
