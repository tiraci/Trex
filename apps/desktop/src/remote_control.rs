//! The desktop's remote-control state: a process-wide [`SessionRegistry`] that the
//! in-app iroh host serves, plus an `enabled` flag that gates whether live agent
//! sessions are fanned into it at all, and the running [`HostHandle`] itself.
//!
//! Held as a [`gpui::Global`] so any [`AgentChatView`] can bind its session into the
//! registry on connect and tee its `ThreadEvent`s in — but only while remote control
//! is enabled, so a disabled desktop pays **zero** per-event cost (no clone, no
//! registration). The registry itself is `gpui`-free and lives behind an `Arc`, so
//! the network layer subscribes and commands sessions off the UI thread. The
//! enablement toggle binds/stops the iroh host through the shared `&Global` (the
//! async bind runs on the tokio runtime; the resulting handle folds back here).
