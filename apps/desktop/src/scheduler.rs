//! The desktop's half of scheduled agent runs: its firer, its keep-awake
//! reconcile, and the boot shell that decides whether this process ticks.
//!
//! The engine — due-selection, the double-launch guards, the durable claim,
//! run recording — is [`trex_agents::schedule::Ticker`], shared with the
//! headless host. What is desktop-specific rides here:
//!
//! - **Firing opens a tab.** The fire crosses to the GPUI thread over the same
//!   launch bridge remote-control launches use ([`BridgeLauncher`]), with the
//!   schedule's prompt as the session's first message. A desktop with no
//!   window answers [`FireOutcome::NotNow`], leaving the occurrence due until
//!   a window exists — a missed run for a recoverable condition would read as
//!   a broken feature.
//! - **Keep-awake.** While any schedule is enabled the desktop holds a sleep
//!   assertion, reconciled once per tick via the firer's `on_tick` hook.
//! - **The ticker lock.** One process per data directory ticks. The desktop
//!   contends for `schedule-ticker.lock` at install; losing it (a headless
//!   host already serving this data dir) logs one clear line and starts no
//!   loop — schedules stay readable and editable, they just fire elsewhere.
//!
//! The loop itself runs on the GPUI **background** executor: the tick's store
//! reads must not stall a frame, and the fire path no longer needs the UI
//! thread directly — the bridge hops for it.
