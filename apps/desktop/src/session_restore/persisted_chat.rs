//! Per-session Agent Chat transcript persistence.
//!
//! A restored chat tab needs two things the pane-layout blob can't cheaply
//! carry: the full message history (to paint instantly, before the resumed
//! process says anything) and the `session_id` (to `claude --resume`). Both are
//! stored here as a compact JSON blob under a dedicated settings key, one per
//! chat session — `agent_chat:<session_id>`.
//!
//! Why a separate key rather than embedding in the `terminal_tabs:*` layout
//! blob: that blob has a 64 KiB cap sized for tab topology, and a long
//! conversation would blow it. Keying per session sidesteps the cap and lets a
//! transcript grow independently. The layout blob only stores the tab's
//! `session_id` pointer (in `PersistedTabKind::AgentChat`); this module owns the
//! body. Save/load run from `project_panes_factory`, which already holds the
//! `SettingsRepo` — the pane snapshot carries transcripts in-memory
//! (`PersistedTabs::chat_transcripts`, `#[serde(skip)]`) so the factory never
//! needs the repo threaded any deeper.
