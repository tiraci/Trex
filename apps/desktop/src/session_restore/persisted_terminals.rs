//! Per-project terminal-tab persistence.
//!
//! Stored as a single JSON blob in the `settings` table under the key
//! `terminal_tabs:<project_id>` (size cap 64 KiB — generous for dozens of
//! tabs with deep split trees). The blob captures tab labels, active
//! index, the next monotonic label counter, and each tab's pane tree
//! (axes + weights + leaf count). Per-pane cwd is **not** persisted — all
//! panes restore at the owning project's `root_path`.
//!
//! What is **not** persisted:
//! - PTY scrollback / running command output (the shell process is dead).
//!   Restored shells start with a fresh prompt.
//! - Per-pane focus inside a tab (active leaf restores to the first leaf).
//! - Live agent process — the `CliRuntime` session dies with the app. On
//!   restore the adapter respawns with the same `{adapter, worktree, model,
//!   effort}` it had before and reloads its own conversation from disk.
