//! Does splitting a text run by **colour alone** change how the text is shaped?
//!
//! Phase 7's streaming fade veil rests on the claim that it does not: the veil
//! paints newly-arrived characters in a fading colour, and that is only safe if
//! a colour boundary is invisible to layout. If a colour split moved a wrap
//! point, the veil would reflow text as it faded — worse than no veil at all.
//!
//! The claim cannot be checked with a `#[gpui::test]`. GPUI's test platform
//! installs `NoopTextSystem`, whose `layout_line` ignores its `runs` argument
//! entirely and advances every character by a fixed em width, so a colour split
//! is *by construction* invisible there — such a test would pass whether or not
//! the real shaper agreed. This probe boots a headless **real** platform and
//! asks the real text system instead.
//!
//! Two details of the pinned rev make the question worth asking rather than
//! assuming. `WindowTextSystem::shape_text` starts a new `FontRun` whenever the
//! decoration changes, and colour is part of the decoration — so a colour split
//! *is* a font-run split by the time the shaper sees it. And `MacTextSystem`
//! deliberately alternates each run's font size by one ULP to stop CoreText
//! forming ligatures across a run boundary. Colour therefore reaches the shaper
//! by two separate paths, neither of which is obviously layout-neutral.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p trex-app --example veil_shaping_probe
//! ```
