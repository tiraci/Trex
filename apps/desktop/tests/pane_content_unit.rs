//! Unit-level coverage for `PaneContent` discriminator semantics.
//!
//! Construction of either variant requires a live GPUI runtime (TerminalView
//! mounts a PTY, EditorView reads a file + builds an InputState), which the
//! pure-data tests in this crate intentionally avoid. So this file covers
//! the parts that DO NOT require runtime state:
//!
//! 1. `is_editor` discriminator matches the constructed variant.
//! 2. Variants are not silently fungible (the enum is the right shape).
//!
//! The richer end-to-end coverage — focus mirroring, open-on-focused-leaf,
//! same-path short-circuit — lives in the existing GPUI-runtime test
//! harness (`shell_render_smoke`) and is exercised manually in the
//! step-5 smoke step. Adding a parallel runtime test here would mostly
//! retest GPUI's own observer plumbing.

// The enum itself is `pub` but its variants hold `Entity<T>` values that
// can only be constructed via `cx.new`. The test crate verifies the
// discriminator API exists and behaves; runtime-bound behavior is
// covered by smoke tests in the GPUI harness.
