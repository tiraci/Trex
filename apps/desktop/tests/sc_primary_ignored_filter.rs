//! Regression: when the only "changes" are Ignored entries (git status
//! --ignored echoes back `target/`, `dist/`, etc.), the primary action
//! must read as a disabled Commit — NOT Stage All. The file-list panel
//! filters those rows out, so the button has to match or the user sees
//! "No changes on this branch" right above an enabled `Stage All` button.
//!
//! These tests exercise the source_control::Render-side filter that
//! sits on top of `resolve_primary_action`. The filter mirrors the
//! ignored-skip in `changed_files::partition_files`.
