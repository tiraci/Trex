//! The outcome-to-UI half of `Merge into <default>`.
//!
//! `MergeOutcome::AutoStashed` **wraps** another variant instead of sitting
//! beside it, so the real shape of a merge result is a cross-product —
//! {no stash, stash popped, stash stranded} × {FastForward, Merged,
//! AlreadyUpToDate, Conflicted} — not a five-row table. A caller that matches
//! `AutoStashed` as a peer of the others reports "merged" for a merge that did
//! nothing, and loses the pointer to the user's stashed work while doing it.
//!
//! These tests walk that product. The real-git half (that git actually produces
//! each of these shapes) lives in
//! `crates/worktree-ops/tests/workspace_merge.rs`; this file asserts what the
//! user is told about each one.
