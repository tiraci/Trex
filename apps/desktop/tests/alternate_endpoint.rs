//! The provider-env phase's headline criterion, proven end to end against a
//! real socket and a real child process rather than asserted about.
//!
//! **Why this lives in its own test binary.** It prepends a directory to the
//! process `PATH` so the agent binary resolves to a shim, which is the same
//! mechanism a real install is found by. `std::env::set_var` mutates state
//! shared by every thread in the process, so doing it inside the 1800-test lib
//! suite would be a data race against whatever else is running — flaky in both
//! directions, and unsound regardless of whether it happens to pass. One test,
//! one binary, one mutation, restored before the assertions.
//!
//! **What is and is not stubbed.** Only the far side of the socket. The
//! settings type, the env resolution, `ConnectSpec`, the StreamJson connect
//! arm, the spawn, and the endpoint are all real. The shim stands in for the
//! agent CLI, and it is the honest stand-in: it does the one thing the criterion
//! is about — read `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` from its environment and send traffic
//! there.
//!
//! The settings → `ChatBackend` leg is covered separately by
//! `workspace_root::tests::two_profiles_of_one_adapter_resolve_to_different_chat_env`
//! (that resolver is crate-private, so an integration test cannot call it).
//! Here the backend is built from `AgentLaunchSettings::env_for`, which is the
//! public accessor that resolver delegates to.
