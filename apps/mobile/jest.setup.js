 *
 * keyboard-controller ships a jest stand-in that tracks the real API — its `/jest`
 * entry returns a zero-height keyboard, the right value for a headless render.
 * reanimated v4's shipped mock, though, pulls its real native initializers and
 * cannot load under Node, and its `GestureDetector` in turn drives reanimated
 * internals — so both get small hand-written stubs covering exactly the surface
 * these components use. Animated hosts pass children through, shared values are
 * plain boxes, the timing/spring helpers resolve instantly (firing their completion
 * callback), and gestures are inert chainable builders — so a `visible` sheet
 * renders its content exactly as on device, which is what every sheet test asserts.
