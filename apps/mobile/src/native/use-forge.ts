/**
 * A session repository's issues, pull requests and CI checks.

 * **An empty result is not an error state and this hook must not present it as
 * one.** The desktop cannot distinguish "no matching items" from "no forge CLI
 * installed", "CLI signed out", "repo hosted elsewhere" or "network down" — so
 * neither can this. `error` is reserved for a failed *round trip* to the
 * desktop, which is a real, actionable failure; everything else lands as an
 * empty list and the screen says "nothing here".
 *
 * Fetched on demand rather than kept live. Each call shells out to `gh`/`glab`
 * on the desktop and is network-bound, so polling would put a slow, rate-limited
 * request on a timer for data that changes on human timescales. `refresh` is the
 * pull-to-refresh path.
