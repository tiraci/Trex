/**
 * The composer's model and permission-mode controls.
 *
 * A hook rather than a component because its two halves belong in different
 * places in the tree: the chips sit *inside* the composer's control row, while
 * the pickers are full-width bottom sheets that must be anchored to the screen.
 * A sheet positions itself absolutely against its parent, so rendering it beside
 * the chips would pin it to a 32pt-tall row instead of the window.
 *
 * Each chip is omitted when its backend offers no options — a fix-at-spawn agent
 * with an empty catalog, or one before its handshake completes. Showing a chip
 * that opens an empty sheet, or one that always fails, would be worse than not
 * offering the control at all.
 *
 * Errors go to the screen's own error banner via `onError` rather than to a
 * banner wedged between the input and the buttons, which used to push the whole
 * composer up over the keyboard the moment a switch was refused.
