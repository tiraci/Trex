  {
    q: "Is TREX free?",
    a: "Yes. It is open source under Apache-2.0. You bring your own agent CLIs and your own credentials.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does my code leave my machine?",
    a: "No. Agents run as local subprocesses and talk to their own providers exactly as they would in your terminal. TREX does not proxy inference, store credentials, or upload your repository anywhere.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which agents are supported?",
    a: "Claude Code, Codex, and Pi have dedicated adapters, and any agent that speaks the Agent Client Protocol works through the ACP runtime. Existing OpenCode and Copilot sessions can be imported from their own stores. Anything else that runs in a terminal runs in a terminal tab.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need new API keys or a new subscription?",
    a: "No. TREX launches each provider's own CLI as a subprocess, so it uses whatever plan and login that CLI already has. Nothing is resold.",
  },
  {
    q: "What platforms does it run on?",
    a: "macOS 13.0 or later and Windows x64, with a companion mobile client for pairing a phone to a desktop host. Linux desktop is not supported yet.",
  },
  {
    q: "How stable is it?",
    a: "It is a working cockpit in active development and is used daily for real repository work, but it is pre-1.0. Expect rough edges and breaking changes.",
