//! Restricting a file to the account that created it.
//!
//! The app writes several things to disk that are only meaningful as secrets:
//! the relay's auth token, the Remote Control private signing key. On unix each
//! of these is `0600` and that is the whole story. Windows has no mode bits, and
//! the file's access comes from ACEs inherited from whatever directory it landed
//! in — which is a policy set somewhere else, by someone else, and readable to
//! whoever that policy happens to admit.
//!
//! So on Windows the DACL is stated rather than inherited, and stated
//! *protected*, so inheritance cannot widen it afterwards. Callers get one
//! function that means "only I can read this" and does not make them care which
//! of those two mechanisms is in play.
//!
//! This lives in its own crate because the three callers — the desktop app, the
//! relay daemon, and the remote host — have no other crate in common. The
//! alternative was the same SID lookup written out three times, which is how
//! security code drifts.
//!
//! # Directories are not files, and Windows is not unix
//!
//! [`prepare_owner_only_dir`] exists because the app's whole data directory —
//! not just the individual secrets in it — has to be closed to other accounts.
//! The two platforms need different things from it:
//!
//! - On unix `0700` on the directory is sufficient on its own. Denying `x`
//!   denies traversal, so nothing inside is reachable by another user no matter
//!   how permissive its own mode is.
//! - On Windows it is **not** sufficient. `SeChangeNotifyPrivilege` ("bypass
//!   traverse checking") is granted to Everyone by default, so a restrictive
//!   DACL on a directory does not stop anyone who knows the full path to a file
//!   inside it. The directory's ACE is therefore written *inheritable*, so
//!   files created later carry it too — and files that already existed still
//!   need their own [`restrict_file`], because inheritance is applied at
//!   creation and never retroactively.
