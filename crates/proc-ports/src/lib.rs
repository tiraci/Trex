//! Which local TCP ports a given set of processes is listening on.
//!
//! A dev server announces itself by printing a URL, and then that line scrolls
//! away. The socket does not scroll away: it exists for exactly as long as the
//! server is willing to accept a connection, and the kernel will name the
//! process holding it. Asking the kernel is therefore the only answer to
//! "what is listening, and did I start it" that survives a cleared screen, a
//! server that prints nothing, and a server that printed a URL it is not
//! actually reachable at.
//!
//! Sibling of [`trex-proc-tree`](../../proc-tree) and
//! [`trex-proc-cwd`](../../proc-cwd), and its own crate for the same reason
//! both of those are: dependency-light kernel introspection whose consumers
//! share nothing else with each other.
//!
//! ## Two queries, and why both exist
//!
//! [`listening_ports_of`] answers for pids the caller names;
//! [`listening_ports`] answers for the whole machine. They are the same read
//! with and without a filter, and the choice is a real trade:
//!
//! * The scoped query is cheap and self-limiting. On Linux especially: the
//!   owning pid is *not in the socket table*, so `/proc/net/tcp` names an
//!   inode and turning an inode into a pid means reading `/proc/<pid>/fd`.
//!   Scoped to a handful of candidates that is a few dozen `readlink` calls;
//!   unscoped it is one pass over every process on the system.
//! * The unscoped query is the only one that can see a server the caller did
//!   not start — a dev server launched from another terminal app, a database
//!   in a container, a daemon holding the port a build is about to want. A
//!   caller that only ever asks about its own children cannot tell "nothing is
//!   running" apart from "it is running, somewhere else", and those are
//!   different answers to the only question a person opens a ports list to ask.
//!
//! Attribution — deciding which of those rows belongs to which of the caller's
//! projects — is the caller's job, not this crate's. This crate reports what
//! the kernel says and stops there.
//!
//! ## Per platform
//!
//! **Windows**: `GetExtendedTcpTable(TCP_TABLE_OWNER_PID_LISTENER)` for both
//! address families. The owning pid is a column, so there is no second pass.
//!
//! **Linux**: `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/tcp6` for the listening sockets
//! and their inodes, then the candidate pids' own `/proc/<pid>/fd` links to
//! find which of them holds one.
//!
//! **macOS**: `lsof`. `proc_pidfdinfo(PROC_PIDFDSOCKETINFO)` is the direct
//! route and is what a bigger crate should use, but `socket_fdinfo` is not in
//! `libc` — taking it would mean hand-declaring a nested union whose layout is
//! private to the SDK, inside a crate whose whole argument for existing is
//! being small enough to audit. `lsof` ships with the OS, its `-F` output is a
//! documented machine format, and the cost is one short-lived process every
//! few seconds. If that ever stops being cheap enough, the honest fix is the
//! FFI, not a faster parser.
