/// What this cannot do — stated plainly because the boundary matters: an agent
/// process runs as the same OS user as the desktop, so it can *read the
/// operator token file itself* and present that. No file permission separates
/// two processes of one user; closing that needs OS-level isolation for agent
/// children (a macOS sandbox profile, a separate uid, a namespace). Until that
/// exists, this crate's confinement holds against an agent that misuses the
/// protocol, not against one that goes around it. See
