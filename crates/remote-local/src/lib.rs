//! Local control transport: the owner-only socket the `TREX` CLI uses to
//! reach a host on the same machine.
//!
//! Trust is **two factors, never reachability alone**:
//!
//! 1. **Reachability** — the socket lives in the host's runtime directory,
//!    which is held at owner-only permissions and *verified by readback*
//!    before the listener binds ([`secure`]). On Windows the pipe carries an
//!    explicit owner-only security descriptor instead, because the pipe
//!    namespace has no containing directory.
//! 2. **A bearer token** — proven by the relay's HMAC-over-nonces handshake
//!    ([`hello`]): the token itself never crosses the socket, the host proves
//!    it holds the token *first*, and the comparison is constant-time. A
//!    caller that cannot prove the token is refused before any RPC flows.
//!
//! The scope a connection is granted (operator-level, or confined to one agent
//! session) follows from **which credential proved out**, never from anything
//! the caller declares: the listener registers one secret per identity, and a
//! connection earns that identity's scope by proving its secret. Naming an
//! identity you cannot prove fails the handshake and grants nothing.
//!
//! # Threat boundary
//!
//! **`TREX serve` confines its agents; the desktop app does not yet.** Serve
//! calls [`LocalControlListener::grant_session`] and injects
//! [`SESSION_TOKEN_ENV_VAR`] for every agent it spawns or resumes, so an agent
//! there reaches its own conversation and nothing else. The desktop's agents
//! are spawned by its chat views, which do not mint a credential, so an agent
//! that runs `TREX` on the desktop takes the operator path and is served full
//! scope. Anyone reading this to decide whether to enable the desktop's local
//! access should read it as: enabling it gives every agent that desktop spawns
//! the operator's authority.
//!
//! What the mechanism buys where it *is* wired: an agent handed a per-session
//! secret and asked to misuse the protocol — naming operator scope, or another
//! session — is refused, because scope follows the secret proved rather than
//! the label claimed. What it will still **not** stop is an agent that goes
//! around the protocol: it runs as the same OS user as the host, so it can read
//! the operator token file and present that instead. File permissions cannot
//! separate two processes of one user, and closing that needs OS-level
//! isolation for agent children (a macOS sandbox profile, a separate uid, or a
//! namespace). That work is not in this crate.
