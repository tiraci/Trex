//! The local handshake: prove the token, claim a scope.
//!
//! The relay's v8 discipline, reused via its `relay-proto` primitives: the
//! token never crosses the socket; each side proves possession with
//! `HMAC(token, server_nonce, client_nonce)`, the **host proves first** (so a
//! squatter socket learns nothing and the CLI can refuse it), and comparisons
//! are constant-time. The scope claim rides the client's proof message —
//! carried here, enforced by the dispatcher's ACL.
//!
//! Rides the already-framed [`Transport`], so the handshake and the RPCs that
//! follow share one framing layer instead of a raw-stream phase with its own.
