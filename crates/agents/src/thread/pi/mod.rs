//! Pi chat backend — drives `pi --mode rpc` as a subprocess.
//!
//! Pi speaks neither ACP nor app-server; `--mode rpc` is its own public,
//! purpose-built embedding protocol (a package export, `"./rpc-entry"`). The
//! Node SDK is deliberately NOT embedded: it is unavailable to Rust, and its one
//! extra capability (`beforeToolCall`) is unused even by pi's own GUI.
//!
//! Layout mirrors `thread/codex/`: [`transport`] owns the pipe, [`protocol`] the
//! wire types, and this module the connection + lifecycle.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle, and why SIGTERM specifically
//!
//! pi registers a handler for **SIGTERM/SIGHUP only** — there is no SIGINT
//! handler, so Claude's SIGINT-to-end-a-turn idiom does not transfer here and is
//! never used. Stopping a turn is the in-band `abort` command.
//!
//! Shutdown must SIGTERM rather than SIGKILL, but *not* to flush the session:
//! there is no shutdown-time session flush at all (`dispose()` aborts and
//! invalidates, persisting nothing). SIGTERM matters because it is the **only**
//! path that runs pi's `killTrackedDetachedChildren()`: pi's bash tool spawns
//! *detached* children and tracks their pids, so a SIGKILL leaves every running
//! tool tree (a dev server, a build) orphaned forever. pi's own orchestrator
//! stops its child the same way.

/// - **id** → looked up in the current project's store. A miss is loud: pi
///   prints `No session found matching '<id>'` and exits 1. Our handshake then
///   fails with that text attached, and the user is told.
/// - **path** → anything containing a slash or ending `.jsonl` is taken as a
///   path **with no existence check**. A stale path therefore does not fail — pi
///   *creates* a new empty session there and starts normally (verified live:
///   `messageCount: 0`, a fresh session id). TREX would render the restored
///   transcript above an agent that remembers nothing, and neither the user nor
///   any assertion on the response could tell.
///
/// So a path-shaped reference is rejected here rather than passed on: the only
/// resume route whose failure is *observable* is the id. This is the same silent
/// class as `switch_session` on a missing path, and choosing the id closes it by
/// construction instead of guarding after the fact.
///
/// The caller must also spawn in the session's own cwd. pi scopes its store per
/// project; an id belonging to a different project takes a third branch that
/// asks `Fork this session into current directory? [y/N]` on **stdin** — which
/// in `--mode rpc` is the command pipe. Verified live: pi consumed the
/// handshake as the answer, printed `Aborted.` and exited **0**.
