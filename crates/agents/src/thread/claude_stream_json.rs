// The model/mode/effort options Claude offers, owned by the backend that
// speaks them (not the view) so the composer can render whatever the live
// connection advertises. Surfaced through the `AgentConnection` accessors below.

/// Claude model aliases offered in the model picker, as `(wire, label, blurb)`.
/// The CLI accepts the `wire` alias directly as `--model`; the `label` is the
/// capitalized name shown in the picker; the `blurb` is a one-line capability
/// hint rendered muted beneath the name (and matched by the model search).
///
/// **The alias is the wire value, and the version lives in the blurb** — the
/// shape the CLI's own `/model` picker uses ("Opus" → "Opus 5 · Best for
/// everyday, complex tasks"). An alias means "the latest of this family", so
/// pinning a full id (`claude-opus-5`) instead would quietly keep running last
/// year's model after the CLI moved on. The cost is that a new release dates the
/// blurb until this list is refreshed — a stale *description*, never a stale
/// pick, which is the right way round.
///

/// than written here, so the two agree on which model is "most capable" — a
