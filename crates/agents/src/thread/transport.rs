//! Kept in the pure, gpui-free `thread` core (deliberately NOT in
//! `trex-settings`, which pulls in `gpui` and would pollute this core). It
//! doubles as the persisted `provider` tag on a saved transcript and drives the
//! connection factory ([`super::connect`], added in a later phase). The
//! settings crate has its own TOML-facing `Transport`; the app crate (which
//! depends on both) maps one to the other when it builds a `ConnectSpec`.

/// Agent Client Protocol. `Rpc` drives Pi over its own newline-JSON `--mode rpc`
/// protocol (Pi speaks neither ACP nor app-server). `OmpRpc` drives omp — a Pi
/// fork whose wire protocol kept Pi's event taxonomy but renamed/extended the
/// command layer and added a versioned handshake, so it is its OWN transport:
/// reusing `Rpc` would let every `Transport::Rpc` match site silently treat an
