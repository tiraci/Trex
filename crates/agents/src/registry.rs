//! Startup-time inventory of CLI agent adapters.
//!
//! Step 8 deliverable: bundle every built-in adapter, scan PATH once at
//! boot, and hand the launch-dialog UI a list of which agents the user
//! actually has installed. The registry stays decoupled from `CliRuntime`
//! so adapters can be enumerated for the dialog without forcing a runtime
//! to exist yet (the UI lives in a thread that hasn't built the runtime
//! when the dropdown first paints).
//!
//! ## Detection cost
//!
//! `detect()` shells out to `which <bin>` per adapter — roughly 15 ms
//! each, so the five adapters run ~75 ms wall-clock total at cold boot,
//! still well under the 200 ms felt threshold. Sequential stays
//! intentional — the `JoinSet` alternative remains premature until
//! cold-start telemetry shows detection crossing that threshold, at which
//! point swap the loop body for a `tokio::task::JoinSet` walk.
//!
//! ## Errors fold to unavailable
//!
//! A `detect()` `Err` is logged at WARN and treated as `available = false`.
//! Rationale: a single bad adapter must not block boot for the other
//! three. The most likely failure mode is `which` missing from PATH or
//! the spawn returning an I/O error — neither of which the user can
//! act on from a panic.
