//! The shared tick engine behind scheduled agent runs — one implementation for
//! every host, desktop or headless.
//!
//! **Level-triggered, not edge-triggered.** `due()` asks `next_fire_at <= now`
//! rather than "did a boundary just pass", so a tick that arrives late — or does
//! not arrive at all, because the machine slept through it — still catches the
//! occurrence on the next pass. That is what makes [`TICK`] a latency knob
//! rather than a correctness one, and it is why nothing here tries to align to
//! wall-clock boundaries.
//!
//! What differs per host is *how a fire happens* — the desktop opens a tab on
//! its UI thread, the headless host spawns straight into its registry — so that
//! is the [`ScheduleFirer`] seam, and everything else (due-selection, the
//! double-launch guards, the durable claim, run recording) lives here once.
//! The loop shell itself also stays host-side: the desktop's executor is GPUI
//! and the headless host's is tokio, and a four-line `loop { tick; sleep }`
//! per host is cheaper than abstracting over their timers. Hosts call
//! [`Ticker::tick`] on their own cadence.
//!
//! **One ticker per data directory.** Ownership is decided by an advisory lock
//! on [`TICKER_LOCK_FILENAME`] (via `trex-single-instance`), acquired before
//! the loop starts; a process that loses the contest runs no ticker and says so
//! once. The lock is what makes cross-process double-fire impossible; the
//! durable claim in [`ScheduleStore::begin_fire`] is the belt to that brace,
//! and it is also what lets a manual run-now and the tick loop coexist.
