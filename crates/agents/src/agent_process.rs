//! Recognise an agent CLI from a process in a terminal's process tree.
//!
//! The window title and the status sideband only describe an agent that
//! chooses to describe itself: the title is opt-in for several CLIs and absent
//! by default in others, and the sideband exists only where TREX installed
//! hooks. A running process is neither optional nor polite — it is there for
//! as long as the agent is, whether or not the agent is producing output.
//! That makes the process tree the one presence signal that covers every CLI
//! and survives an idle agent, which is what this module reads.
//!
//! Identity comes from the argument vector, not the executable name. Two
//! measurements decided that, and both are the difference between working and
//! not:
//!
//! * The kernel names a process for the binary it *resolved*, so a CLI invoked
//!   through a symlink is named for the link's target. Every common agent
//!   installs exactly that way — one of them points at a file named for its
//!   version number, which matches nothing. `argv[0]` keeps the path the user
//!   actually invoked.
//! * The executable name was also seen reporting an agent's name for a process
//!   that was plainly something else. A signal that can say "claude" about a
//!   `grep` is not one to hang a sidebar row on.
//!
//! The argument vector fixes both, and handles the second shape for free: a
//! CLI shipped as a script (`gemini`, `pi`) runs under its interpreter, where
//! only the arguments name it — `node /opt/homebrew/bin/gemini`. The
//! executable name is kept as a fallback for platforms that cannot read
//! arguments, where it is the only signal and the symlink convention does not
//! apply.
