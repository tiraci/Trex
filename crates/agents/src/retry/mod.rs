//! Automatic retry of a turn that failed on a provider limit.
//!
//! Split so the part that is easy to get wrong is testable without a clock:
//! [`classify`] turns typed wire signals into a [`RetryClass`], and
//! [`schedule`] is a pure function from `(class, attempt, now, settings, seed)`
//! to a wake time. Nothing here starts a timer or touches a thread.
//!
//! ## Why this does not reuse the schedule ticker
//!
//! The plan called for reusing `crate::schedule`. It cannot be reused, for four
//! independent reasons, each of which alone is disqualifying:
//!
//! 1. `Recurrence` has no one-shot variant and enforces a five-minute floor at
//!    construction — a retry is a single fire, often sooner than that.
//! 2. A `Schedule` is a user-visible row with a name and an enabled flag,
//!    listed by the Schedules UI and `TREX schedule ls`, and carried on the
//!    remote wire as `RecurrenceWire`. Internal retries do not belong there,
//!    and the wire type is frozen.
//! 3. The ticker runs under a single per-data-dir role lock, so it fires in
//!    whichever host holds that lock. A retry must fire in the process that
//!    owns the thread, which is not necessarily the same one.
//! 4. `nudge_existing_session` deliberately wraps its prompt in a preamble
//!    telling the agent a timer armed it. A retry must resend the user's own
//!    prompt verbatim.
//!
//! What is reused is the *shape*: a pure time-arithmetic module tested without
//! a database, matching `schedule::recurrence`.
