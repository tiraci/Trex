//! Usage-meter data model.
//!
//! The status-bar meter shows each configured agent account's REAL rate-limit
//! utilization, taken from whatever that provider itself publishes — never
//! estimated from local logs. When a source cannot be read the meter reports
//! [`UsageState::Unavailable`] with the reason, rather than guessing a
//! denominator and presenting a fabricated percentage as if it were real.
//!
//! Providers disagree about how many windows they have and how long those
//! windows are, so a reading is a *list* of labeled windows rather than a
//! fixed pair. Labels are derived from the span (see
//! [`UsageWindow::short_label`]), which means a provider reporting a window
//! shape TREX has never seen still renders something true.
