//! `UsageProbe` — blocking sampler producing one [`ProviderUsage`] per
//! configured account.
//!
//! Each provider publishes its usage somewhere different, so each is a
//! [`UsageSource`]: the primary CLI's account usage API (`usage_oauth`), and
//! the rate-limit windows a second CLI journals into its session rollouts
//! (`usage_codex`). Adding a third is an impl, not a rewrite.
//!
//! The sampler owns what is common to all of them and nothing else: a failure
//! backoff so a declined Keychain prompt does not re-ask every tick, the
//! reason from the last failure so a tick inside that backoff still names a
//! cause, and a last-known-good reading for sources that can use one. It never
//! falls back to a local-log estimate — a guessed percentage presented as real
//! is worse than an honest "unavailable".
//!
//! A provider that has left no trace on the machine yields no row at all. That
//! is not the same as a row reporting a failure: "you do not use this CLI" and
//! "this CLI is broken" must not look alike.
//!
//! Blocking shellout (Keychain + curl) and file reads — callers MUST run
//! `sample()` on a background executor.
