//! Shared detection helper for CLI adapters.
//!
//! Every concrete `CliAgentAdapter` implementation answers `detect()` by
//! asking "is this binary on PATH?" The first adapter (`claude_code.rs`,
//! step 5) inlined the helper; the second (`codex.rs`, step 6) is its
//! second caller — promoting now keeps later adapters from sprouting a
//! fresh copy each.
//!
//! Contract: never `Err`. A missing tool is `Ok(false)`, not a panic —
//! the startup registry calls this for every adapter at cold boot and a
//! failure here would prevent any adapter from showing up in the dialog.
