//! Team runs: one fan-out of roles, each worked by its own agent session,
//! recorded host-side so the run outlives the process that started it.
//!
//! **Why this is host state and not a script's bookkeeping.** A client-side
//! orchestrator holds its run in memory: kill it, or restart the host, and the
//! run is gone while the sessions it started carry on unattached. Keeping the
//! run in the host's own database makes the opposite true — a host that comes
//! back reads its open roles, re-associates the ones whose sessions still
//! exist, and settles the ones whose sessions do not. That is the whole reason
//! the table exists.
//!
//! The store has no opinion about *how* roles are started; that is the host's
//! launcher. It records what was started, what each role reported, and when.
