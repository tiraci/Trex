//! Process-wide, gpui-free session registry — the event bus + command surface
//! every remote surface (and eventually the desktop view) hangs off.
//!
//! A [`SessionRegistry`] maps `session_id → `[`SessionHandle`], each holding the
//! shared `Arc<dyn AgentConnection>`, a monotonically-`seq`-indexed replayable
//! backlog, a live broadcast fan-out, an atomic idempotent-resolve gate, and a
//! coarse status snapshot. Every method is callable from a plain tokio task with
//! no `gpui::Context` in scope, so the network layer can subscribe and command a
//! session without going through the view.
//!
//! Three correctness properties are load-bearing (see the phase's red-team notes):
//!
//! 1. **Atomic idempotent resolve.** A permission is decided through exactly one
//!    gate ([`SessionHandle::resolve_permission`]); the desktop's Allow/Deny path
//!    and any remote path route through the same method, so two concurrent callers
//!    for one `request_id` can't both fire `conn.resolve_permission`.
//! 2. **Seq-indexed durable backlog.** `broadcast` can't replay (a lagging receiver
//!    gets `Lagged` and permanently loses events), so a bounded `VecDeque` backlog
//!    backs [`SessionHandle::events_since`] for reconnect gap-fill. The broadcast is
//!    only the live edge.
//! 3. **Off-thread command surface.** `send_prompt` / `steer` / `cancel` /
//!    `resolve_permission` are plain `&self` calls on the shared `Arc`.
