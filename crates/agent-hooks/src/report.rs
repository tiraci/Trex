//! What `TREX agent-status` decides, separated from how it delivers it.
//!
//! An agent's hook runs a command and hands it the event as JSON on stdin. All
//! of what that command has to work out — which dialect's payload shape it is
//! reading, whether this event should report anything at all, and what the
//! resulting sideband blob says — is decided here, from arguments and bytes.
//!
//! It lives apart from the send for two reasons. The delivery half needs a
//! tokio runtime, the relay client and the data directory, none of which this
//! half has any use for; and both the desktop app and `trex-cli` run this
//! verb, so a second copy of the decision would be a second set of dialect
//! bugs. What each binary keeps is the ~20 lines that open its own socket.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of its inputs — no env, no stdin, no
//! clock — which is why it can be tested at all. The version that lived inside
//! the desktop's `main.rs` read all three directly and had no tests.
