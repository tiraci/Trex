//! The status extension TREX writes into Pi's extensions directory.
//!
//! Pi has no hooks file. Its extension point is an in-process TypeScript API —
//! `pi.on("agent_end", …)` — so the only way to learn what a Pi agent said is
//! to hand Pi a program that tells us. That program is this one: TREX renders
//! it at install time with the absolute path of its own binary baked in, writes
//! it into the directory Pi discovers extensions from, and Pi loads it on every
//! subsequent start.
//!
//! Everything downstream is unchanged. The extension shells out to the same
//! `TREX agent-status` CLI every hooks-file agent runs and hands it JSON on
//! stdin, so from the relay onward a Pi row is indistinguishable from a Claude
//! one. It composes that JSON in Claude's key names for the same reason — one
//! reader, not a Pi-shaped special case.
//!
//! The event sequence is measured, not assumed. A run of
//! `pi -p 'reply with only the word DONE'` produced, in order:
//! `session_start`, `message_start`, `agent_start`, `message_end` (role
//! `user`), `message_start`, `message_end` (role `assistant`), `agent_end`,
//! `session_shutdown` — with the reply itself under
//! `message.content[].text`, an array of parts exactly like Claude's.
//!
//! Two consequences of that ordering shape the code below:
//!
//! * The reply arrives BEFORE the turn ends, on its own event, so it is held
//!   and attached to the `agent_end` report. Reporting it as it arrives would
//!   put a row into idle while the agent is still working.
//! * Pi dispatches BOTH `before_agent_start` and `agent_start` for one turn,
//!   and both `agent_end` and `session_shutdown` to end it. Subscribing to
//!   only one of each pair would be a bet on a version; subscribing to both
//!   and dropping the repeat is not.
