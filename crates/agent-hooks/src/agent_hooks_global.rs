//! Global status-hook install/remove in every agent's own configuration.
//!
//! What each agent wants written, and where, is data in
//! [`crate::agent_hook_dialects::DIALECTS`]. This module is the part that is
//! the same whichever agent it is: the merge, the marker, the backup, the
//! atomic write, and the rule that none of it may ever cost the user something
//! they did not ask for ([`sync_dialect`]).
//!
//! The per-spawn `--settings` injection ([`crate::agent_status_hooks`]) only
//! reaches agents TREX launches itself. A `claude` the user types BY HAND in a
//! plain terminal pane carries no `--settings`, so it would never report status.
//! To track it too — the way the reference cockpit does — we install the same
//! status hooks into the user's GLOBAL settings file, which every `claude`
//! invocation reads. Every PTY already carries `trex_PTY_ID` (the relay sets
//! it on spawn), so a hand-typed agent self-attributes to its pane.
//!
//! Safety + correctness:
//! - **Same command strings** as the `--settings` path, so Claude's
//!   command-string hook dedup makes a picker agent (which sees the file hook
//!   AND the `--settings` hook) fire each one exactly once.
//! - **Only into a home the agent already made.** TREX writes into eight
//!   different agents' configuration; creating those directories would leave a
//!   user a dotfile for every agent TREX has heard of, most of which they do
//!   not have.
//! - **Ours are found again, one way or another.** Where the file tolerates
//!   unknown keys our entries carry `"_trex_managed": true`; where it does
//!   not, they are recognised by the command they run. Re-installing drops the
//!   prior ones first, which also refreshes a stale binary path after a
//!   rebuild.
//! - **Non-destructive merge.** We append to the per-event arrays; the user's
//!   existing hooks are preserved. A missing file starts from `{}`; a malformed
//!   file aborts (we never clobber an unparseable user file). A file only
//!   TREX writes is the exception — there is nothing to preserve, so it is
//!   written and deleted whole.
//! - **Atomic + backed up.** First modification copies the file to
//!   `settings.json.trex-bak`; writes go through a temp file + rename.
//! - **Best-effort.** Every failure is logged, never propagated — a hand-typed
//!   agent simply won't self-report if the file can't be written.
