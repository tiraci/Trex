//! Every agent CLI that reports status through a hooks file, in one table.
//!
//! Detecting an agent from the process tree tells the rail *that* it is there,
//! and its window title says roughly what it is doing. Neither can say what the
//! agent SAID — so every row but Claude's showed a bare status verb where a
//! Claude row showed the actual reply. The difference was never the rail; it
//! was that only Claude had hooks installed.
//!
//! The agents differ far less than they look. Every one of them runs a command
//! at fixed lifecycle points and hands it the event as JSON **on stdin**, so
//! the existing `TREX agent-status` CLI is the hook for all of them
//! unchanged. What differs is only: which file the hooks live in, how one entry
//! is spelled in it, what the events are called, and which key carries the
//! reply. All four are data, which is what [`DIALECTS`] is — the installer in
//! [`crate::agent_hooks_global`] and the payload readers below both read from
//! it, so adding an agent is a row rather than a module.
//!
//! Two deliberate non-goals, both learned from Codex:
//!
//! * **A per-turn `notify` program is not used** where an agent offers one.
//!   Those settings hold a single program, not a list, so writing one would
//!   silently replace whatever the user already has there. A hooks file has a
//!   per-event array, so ours can be merged alongside anything else.
//! * **Hook trust is left to the agent.** An agent that holds a trusted-hash
//!   ledger and asks the user to approve a new hook in its own UI gets to keep
//!   doing that. Forging an entry there would be a consent bypass. Until the
//!   user says yes, these hooks simply never fire and the rail falls back to
//!   process + title exactly as before.
