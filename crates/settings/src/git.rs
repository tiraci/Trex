//! Git & Source Control settings — how TREX names the branches it creates,
//! where it puts the worktrees, and whether it freshens the default branch
//! first.
//!
//! Every worktree TREX has ever created is on a branch called
//! `TREX/<slug>`, hardcoded at five sites. That prefix is a reasonable
//! default and a poor requirement: a shared repository shows one contributor's
//! branches under a tool's name rather than under theirs, which is backwards
//! from how every other client names a branch.
//!
//! **The serde shape lives here; the resolution does not.** Turning
//! [`BranchPrefixMode::GitUsername`] into an actual prefix means reading
//! `git config user.name`, and this crate has no git dependency on purpose —
//! see `trex_worktree_ops::branch_name`, which owns that half.
