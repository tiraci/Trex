//! Screen-control settings, loaded from `computer_use.toml` in the app data dir
//! and held as a GPUI [`Global`] so the settings pane and the agent spawn path
//! read one source of truth.
//!
//! Mirrors the `dictation` settings contract: `from_toml_str` / `to_toml_string`
//! / `sanitized`, a `FILE_NAME`, and a live-reload watcher in the app crate.
//!
//! # Two switches, both off by default
//!
//! [`enabled`](ComputerUseSettings::enabled) is the master switch; `projects`
//! then names the project roots that actually get it. Both must say yes, so
//! flipping the master does not hand the screen-control tools to every agent in
//! every project at once — an agent driving the GUI is not something to opt into
//! by side effect.
//!
//! # What the project list does not do
//!
//! It scopes the *tools*, not the *permission*. Turning screen control on
//! anywhere requires TREX to hold macOS Accessibility, because the Escape kill
//! switch is an event tap and a tap does not exist without it. macOS attributes
//! that grant to TREX as the responsible process, and every descendant
//! inherits it — measured, not assumed: a binary spawned from an agent's shell
//! tool reports `AXIsProcessTrusted() == true`, through an intervening helper
//! whose whole job is to disclaim responsibility.
//!
//! So an agent's shell can reach GUI automation in a project that never appears
//! in this list. `trex_computer_use::gui_scripting` refuses the obvious
//! commands that do, and the settings pane says so plainly rather than implying
//! a fence that is not there.
//!
//! # Why this is not a `.trex/` file
//!
//! Every other per-project setting in this crate lives in a git-committable
//! `.trex/*.toml` so a team can share it. That precedent is exactly wrong
//! here: a repository could then ship `enabled = true` and cloning it would
//! grant screen control before the user had seen a single line of its code.
//! The opt-in is keyed by path but stored in the *user's* data dir, where a
//! checkout cannot reach it.
