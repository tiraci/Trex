//! Per-agent launch defaults, loaded from `agent_launch.toml` in the app
//! data dir and held as a GPUI [`Global`] so the launch picker and the
//! agent runtime read one source of truth.
//!
//! These are the knobs the one-click launcher applies when the user picks
//! an agent: extra CLI arguments (e.g. a skip-permissions flag), a default
//! `--model`, and whether the agent is hidden from the picker. A separate
//! `default_agent` marks which adapter the picker surfaces first.
//!
//! Defaults are intentionally empty — a fresh install launches every agent
//! with no extra flags and no model override, exactly as before this file
//! existed. An absent or empty TOML is a no-op.
//!
//! Live-reload: a file watcher (in the app crate) reparses on change and
//! swaps the global, so an edit takes effect on the next launch without a
//! restart. Keys are agent slugs (`claude-code`, `codex`, `pi`) matching
//! [`trex_core::AgentAdapter`]'s adapter id.
