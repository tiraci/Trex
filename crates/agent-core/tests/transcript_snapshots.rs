//! Pinned transcripts for every committed Claude fixture.

//! This is the baseline the assembler extraction (plan phase 4) is measured

//! committed snapshot of the resulting transcript.
//!
//! A failure here means the rewrite changed rendered output. That is sometimes
//! correct — a round-9 fidelity fix, say — but it is never incidental, so the
