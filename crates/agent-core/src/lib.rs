/// Screenshot redaction for transcripts on their way off this machine.

/// Lives here rather than next to the screen-control driver that produces the
/// screenshots, because the two have opposite platform shapes: capture is
/// macOS-only, but a transcript containing captures can be *read* anywhere —
/// agent CLIs keep their session stores in the user's home directory, and those
/// get synced between machines. A Windows build that dropped the filter along
/// with the driver would serve those screenshots to a paired phone. Scrubbing
/// is pure JSON work with no platform surface, so it simply always compiles.
