//! Keeping screen captures off any surface that leaves this machine.
//!
//! A screenshot tool returns a picture of whatever was on screen — a password
//! manager mid-unlock, a private document, someone else's message. On the
//! desktop that is the point: the user is looking at the same screen and can see
//! what the agent saw. On a paired phone it is not. The images ride the ordinary
//! `ToolCall.images` channel and would otherwise reach a phone through normal
//! chat, with nothing about the transfer looking unusual.
//!
//! # Not "strip every image"
//!
//! An agent that reads a PNG the user asked about should still show it on the
//! phone; that image is in the conversation because the user put it there.
//! What is removed is narrower: images produced *by the screen-control server*,
//! identified by the tool that returned them.
//!
//! # Why the event path needs to remember something
//!
//! [`ThreadEvent::ToolResultImages`] carries a `tool_use_id` and pixels — no
//! tool name. So an event cannot be judged on its own, and a stateless filter
//! would have to choose between passing screenshots or dropping every image.
//! [`ScreenshotFilter`] keeps the small amount of correlation needed: which
//! tool-call ids belong to the screen-control server, learned from the
//! `ToolCallStarted` that must precede any result for that id.
//!
