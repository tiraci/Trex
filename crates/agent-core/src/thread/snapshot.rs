//! Transcript snapshot harness — the fidelity floor under the agent mappers.
//!
//! Written as the safety net for a five-way `Assembler` extraction, which was
//! then declined on measurement: the mappers turned out not to be five copies
//! of one lifecycle (Claude's decoder is stateless, Codex is item-lifecycle
//! native, and the one real duplicate already shares `snapshot_diff`). The
//! harness outlived the plan that motivated it, because the evidence behind
//! that plan — nine rounds of render-fidelity work — was never about the
//! assembler. It was about mapper changes altering what the user sees without
//! failing anything.
//!
//! What is pinned is the folded [`ChatThread`], not the event stream. That is
//! deliberate and still load-bearing: event coalescing remains a legitimate
//! future change that would rewrite the stream without moving a pixel, and a
//! pinned `Vec<ThreadEvent>` would report it as a regression. The fold is where
//! "rendered output is unchanged" is actually decidable, because it is what
//! every render path reads.
//!
//! Behind the `test-support` feature so none of this ships: `trex-agents`
//! turns it on in dev-dependencies so both crates pin transcripts identically
//! rather than each growing its own harness.
//!
//! Regenerate after an *intended* change with
//! `UPDATE_TRANSCRIPT_SNAPSHOTS=1 cargo test`, then read the diff before
//! committing it — a snapshot accepted without reading is worse than no
//! snapshot, because it looks like coverage.
