//! Just four items, and they live here rather than beside the driver they
//! describe for one reason: the transcript scrubber in [`crate::redact`] keys
//! on these names, and it has to keep working on platforms that have no driver
//! at all (a synced session store carries a macOS transcript onto any machine).
//! Splitting the *name* from the *implementation* is what lets the redaction
//! path stay unconditional.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure string predicate. `trex-computer-use` re-exports
//! these under its own paths, so there is still exactly one definition.

/// Name the server is declared under. It is not cosmetic: agents namespace MCP
/// tools as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, so this string is the prefix every later
/// policy check matches on. Changing it silently unhooks those checks.
///
/// Prefixed with the app name rather than the bare `computer-use`, which a live
/// run showed is **silently dropped** — declared under that name the server
/// never appears in the session's server list at all, with no error, and the
/// agent simply reports the tools missing. A namespaced name also avoids
/// colliding with a server the user has configured themselves.
