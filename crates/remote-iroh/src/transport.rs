//! A [`Transport`] over a single iroh QUIC bi-directional stream.
//!
//! iroh hands us a raw ordered byte pipe; the `Transport` contract is
//! frame-oriented (one postcard message per `send`/`recv`), so this impl owns the
//! framing: a `u32` big-endian length prefix followed by the message bytes. One
//! long-lived bi-stream carries every frame — not a stream per message — so the
//! demux's reply-in-send-order invariant (the wire has no correlation id) holds.
//!
//! The receive half keeps a `carry` buffer of bytes pulled off the wire but not
//! yet returned as a whole frame. That buffer is what makes [`IrohTransport::recv`]
//! **cancel-safe** (the demux pump drops a half-polled `recv` on its shutdown
//! `select`): read bytes always land in the struct-owned `carry` before any yield,
//! so dropping the future can never lose a partially-read frame.
