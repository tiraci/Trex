//! The iroh P2P transport for TREX remote control.
//!
//! Provides the production [`Transport`](trex_remote_proto::transport::Transport)
//! and [`Connector`](trex_remote_session::Connector) impls that sit beneath the
//! pure-Rust `remote-session` client and the transport-agnostic `remote-host`
//! dispatcher:
//! - [`IrohTransport`] — a framed message channel over one iroh QUIC bi-stream.
//! - [`IrohConnector`] — the client dial seam (resolve host by endpoint id → open
//!   a bi-stream), driven by `remote_session::maintain_connection`.
//! - [`bind_client`] / [`bind_host`] / [`accept`] — endpoint setup + the host
//!   accept loop that hands each connection's transport to the dispatcher.
//!
//! Kept separate from `remote-session` (which stays iroh-free and loopback-
//! testable) and from `remote-proto` (which stays dependency-minimal), so both
//! the desktop host and the mobile core share one framing implementation.
