//! Block-level markdown for streaming agent replies.
//!
//! Two things this crate exists to do, neither of which the renderer it feeds
//! could do for itself:
//!
//! 1. **Parse to a block tree with exact byte ranges.** The ranges are the
//!    point. They are what lets a caller reparse part of a document, and what
//!    lets the transcript treat one block as one row.
//! 2. **Reparse a streaming append in O(delta), not O(document).** A reply
//!    arrives a token at a time and is re-rendered on every batch; re-reading
//!    the whole message per token is quadratic in the length of the reply, and
//!    long replies are exactly where it hurts.
//!
//! **No rendering, no colors, no GPUI.** That boundary is not tidiness — it is
//! what makes this testable in isolation, and it is enforced by the crate having
//! exactly one dependency. Anything that draws belongs to the desktop app.
//!
//! ```
//! use trex_markdown::{Block, IncrementalParser};
//!
//! let mut p = IncrementalParser::new();
//! p.set_text("# Title\n\nfirst para\n\nsecond ");
//! p.set_text("# Title\n\nfirst para\n\nsecond para");
//!
//! assert!(matches!(p.tree().blocks[0].block, Block::Heading { level: 1, .. }));
//! // The heading was kept, not re-read, to append to the last paragraph.
//! assert_eq!(p.stable_prefix_blocks(), 1);
//! assert!(p.last_parse_bytes() < p.text().len());
//! ```
//!
//! Note the shape of that guarantee: the reparse window is the last *two*
//! blocks, so a document with fewer than three has no stable prefix and is
//! simply reparsed whole. That is the cheap case anyway — the cost this crate
//! exists to remove only appears once a reply is long.
