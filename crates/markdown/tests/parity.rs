//! The gate the incremental parser rests on.
//!
//! Every document below is streamed one character at a time, and after **every
//! single character** the incrementally-built tree is compared against a full
//! parse of the same prefix. They must be identical, ranges included.
//!
//! This is deliberately stricter than production, which appends whole tokens.
//! The boundary rule's failure mode is not a crash — it is an occasionally-wrong
//! tree under a specific interleaving, which no amount of looking at the app
//! will find. Splitting at every character is how you hit the interleavings
//! nobody thought of.
//!
//! **If a case here fails, do not weaken it.** The fix is to widen the reparse
//! window or add the construct to the always-full set. A green parity test is
//! the only evidence that "reparse the last two blocks" is sound at all.
