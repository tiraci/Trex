//! The Windows trust anchor, end to end, against a real executable.
//!
//! The unit tests in `trust` cover the store in isolation. This exercises the
//! gate the way `prepare` does — [`verify::verify_pinned`] against a real file
//! on this machine — because the property that matters most is an *ordering*
//! one: the trust verdict has to come before anything executes the candidate,
//! and a store tested on its own cannot show that.
//!
//! Runs everywhere. The anchor is Windows' because Windows has no signature to
//! use, but nothing in it is Windows-specific, and a macOS host running these is
//! the only thing that would catch the gate being wired up per-platform.
