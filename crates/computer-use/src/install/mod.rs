//! One-click driver install: download → gate → crash-safe swap.
//!
//! One pipeline, every platform. The steps that differ — which archive, how to
//! unpack it, what the gate is, how placement swaps — live in [`platform`],
//! which is also where the reasons they differ are written down.
//!
//! # Trust boundary
//!
//! The asset URL comes only from the typed `api.github.com` response (release
//! downloads then 302-redirect to GitHub's asset CDN — host pinning is not the
//! control here, the post-download gates are). `checksums.txt` is transport
//! integrity, not authentication: it ships from the same origin as the archive,
//! so whoever could serve a bad archive could serve a matching hash.
//!
//! What authenticates the bytes is the gate, and it is not the same question on
//! both platforms:
//!
//! - **macOS** asks the publisher. A programmatic download carries no
//!   quarantine xattr, so Gatekeeper never inspects it on its own; the gates in
//!   [`crate::verify`] — codesign integrity, identifier, Team ID, minimum
//!   version, and the bundle-level notarization assessment — are run explicitly
//!   against the **staged** bundle.
//! - **Windows** cannot: every artifact upstream publishes there is unsigned
//!   and carries no build provenance. So it asks the user, once, about these
//!   exact bytes ([`crate::trust`]) — continuity rather than identity, and the
//!   UI built on it must never call the result "verified".
//!
//! Either way the gate runs **before** placement. Nothing lands where
//! [`crate::discovery`] will find it until the gate has answered.
//!
//! # What install deliberately does not do
//!
//! It never stops or restarts the driver daemon — that is a machine-wide
//! singleton other MCP clients share (see [`crate::daemon`]). Placement swaps
//! rather than overwrites (an exchange on macOS, a junction retarget on
//! Windows), so a running daemon keeps the old binary until it next respawns;
//! the UI surfaces that after an upgrade.
//!
//! # Concurrency and progress
//!
//! One install per process, enforced here (settings pane and onboarding both
//! call in). Progress is pushed over an [`mpsc`] channel *and* readable via
//! [`status`] — a pane reopened mid-install pulls the current stage instead of
//! replaying events, which is also why an approval request is a stage and not
//! only an event.
