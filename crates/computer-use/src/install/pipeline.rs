//! The blocking install pipeline: resolve → download → gate → place.
//!
//! Every step here is the same on every platform. The four that are not live in
//! [`super::platform`], behind identical signatures — which is what keeps this
//! file free of `cfg` islands and keeps the two platforms from drifting into
//! two different installers.
//!
//! Network I/O is sync `ureq` with explicit connect/read timeouts — a stalled
//! peer surfaces as an error instead of pinning the thread past a cancel (the
//! cancel flag is only checkable between reads). Runs on the dedicated thread
//! `spawn_install` creates; never on a UI thread.
