//! The four steps of an install that no two platforms agree on.
//!
//! Everything else in `install/` is shared: resolving the release, streaming
//! the download, hashing it as it lands, progress, cancellation, the byte
//! ceiling, the one-install-per-process lock. What differs is narrow and is
//! collected here rather than spread through `pipeline.rs` as `cfg` islands:
//!
//! | step | macOS | Windows |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | archive | `.tar.gz` carrying `CuaDriver.app` | `.zip` of bare executables |
//! | extract | `/usr/bin/tar` | the `zip` crate, in-process |
//! | gate | codesign → identifier → team ID → stapled ticket | nothing automatic; a person |
//! | place | `renamex_np` exchange in `/Applications` | junction retarget over a versioned dir |
//!
//! # Why a `cfg` pair and not a trait
//!
//! Two implementations that are never both live do not need dynamic dispatch,
//! and a trait would put the *shape* in one place while hiding the *reasons* in
//! another. The reasons are the valuable part — see each recipe's module doc.
//!
//! # Linux
//!
//! Upstream publishes Linux archives, but this crate has never been compiled
//! for Linux (`trex-computer-use` is not in the Linux CI crate set, and the
//! desktop app ships for macOS and Windows only). A third recipe would be dead
//! code that no host builds, so the seam is shaped for it and the file is
//! deliberately absent. The `compile_error!` below is what a Linux build would
//! hit: an explicit "write the recipe", not a pile of missing symbols.
