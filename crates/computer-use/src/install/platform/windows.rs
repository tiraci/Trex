//! The Windows recipe: unsigned bytes, a person for a gate, a junction for a
//! swap.
//!
//! # Why TREX downloads this itself
//!
//! Upstream ships `install.ps1`, and it verifies nothing — no checksum, no
//! signature — while a per-asset `checksums.txt` sits unused in the same
//! release (re-confirmed against v0.21.0 on 2026-08-24). Owning the download
//! buys a hash check, a known version, and gate-before-place ordering. It does
//! not buy identity: the artifacts are unsigned and carry no build provenance,
//! so the anchor stays the user's own approval. See [`crate::trust`] for
//! exactly what that does and does not establish.
//!
//! # The layout is upstream's, on purpose
//!
//! Releases land in their own immutable directory and two junctions point at
//! them. That is not cosmetic parity — Windows refuses to overwrite a running
//! `.exe`, so retargeting a junction is the only upgrade that works while the
//! driver is live. Matching upstream's paths also means the two installers
//! coexist: TREX can install over theirs, and theirs over TREX's.
