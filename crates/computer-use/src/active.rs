//! What is being driven right now, in words a person can read at a glance.
//!
//! The indicator's whole job is to answer "is something clicking on my screen,
//! and what?" without the user having to go and look. That answer comes from
//! the grant table rather than from any in-flight call, and the distinction is
//! deliberate:
//!
//! # A held grant is the honest signal, not a call in flight
//!
//! A click takes milliseconds. An indicator that lit only while one was
//! dispatching would flicker at the exact moments it mattered and read as idle
//! the rest of the time — useless as a safety signal, and worse than nothing
//! because the user would learn to trust a dark indicator.
//!
//! A *held grant* means something else: this agent may drive that app at any
//! instant without asking again. That is the state worth showing, it lasts as
//! long as the risk does, and it clears exactly when the risk does — on chat
//! close, on release, on quit.
//!
//! # Read from the table, not from the approval path
//!
//! Grants are also created outside this process: the `PreToolUse` hook resolves
//! provenance itself and can grant a binary the agent just built without TREX
//! ever seeing an approval. Anything that tracked grants by observing the
//! consent card would therefore under-report — showing nothing while an agent
//! drove its own fresh build, which is the most common case this feature has.
