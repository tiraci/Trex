//! Which agent may drive which process.
//!
//! A grant binds a pid to one agent session. It is the only thing standing
//! between two agents driving each other's builds — or an agent driving the
//! user's editor — so the invariant is load-bearing rather than a nicety: drop
//! the pid pinning and cross-driving silently returns with nothing to catch it.
//!
//! Grants record the executable path as well as the pid, and every use
//! re-resolves the pid and compares. Be honest about what that buys: it narrows
//! the window in which a recycled pid could be driven under someone else's
//! grant, it does not close it. The driver re-resolves the pid on its own side
//! of the socket after we answer, so check-then-dispatch cannot be made atomic
//! across that hop from here.
//!
//! # Why a file rather than a mutex
//!
//! Enforcement runs in two processes: TREX itself, and the short-lived
//! `PreToolUse` hook the agent's CLI spawns per tool call. Both must see the
//! same grants, and the cross-drive guard must compare a request against *every
//! other* chat's grants — which a per-process table structurally cannot do once
//! a second process is asking.
//!
//! So the store is a small JSON file guarded by a whole-file exclusive lock,
//! taken through `fd-lock` — the same crate as the app's single-instance
//! guard, which this module was already written to mirror. That is `flock` on
//! unix and `LockFileEx` on Windows. The lock attaches to the open file
//! *description* (unix) / handle (Windows), so a second open within one
//! process contends exactly like a second process — which is what makes the
//! concurrency here testable without spawning anything.
//!
//! # One Windows difference that does not bite, and one that does
//!
//! Windows byte-range locks are **mandatory**, not advisory: while a holder's
//! lock is live, access through any *other* handle fails outright. The app's
//! single-instance guard was bitten by this and records it at
//! `platform::single_instance::pid_path_for`.
//!
//! It is harmless here because every read and write goes through
//! [`GrantTable::with_locked`], on the same handle that holds the lock — the
//! lock owner is never denied its own region. If anything is ever added that
//! reads this file without taking the lock, it will work on macOS and fail on
//! Windows, which is the worst way round to find out.
//!
//! What does differ is the *reasoning* behind [`GrantTable::clear`]'s unlink
//! fallback, though not its outcome. "Unlinking needs permission on the
//! directory, not the file" is POSIX; `DeleteFileW` refuses outright while
//! `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY` is set. The fallback still works because
//! `std::fs::remove_file` clears that attribute first, deliberately matching
//! Unix — so on Windows the guarantee rests on a library promise rather than
//! an OS one. Pinned by `a_read_only_store_is_still_cleared_on_windows`.
//!
//! The genuinely different case is a store another process holds open, which
//! Windows refuses to delete without `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` and Rust does not
//! request. The lock makes this rare — a concurrent holder is normally waited
//! out rather than raced — but unlike the read-only case there is no library
//! guarantee papering over it.
