//! Starting and ending an agent's driver session.
//!
//! A session is where the driver's own capture policy lives, and the policy is
//! chosen once: `capture_scope` is documented **"Immutable for the live
//! session."** TREX pins `window`, which has no escalation path at all —
//! `escalate_session` only unlocks a session that started as `auto`. So a
//! window-pinned session cannot reach desktop-scope tools even if every check
//! in [`crate::policy`] were removed.
//!
//! # Two things that constrain when this can run
//!
//! `cua-driver call` requires a daemon that is **already running**, and refuses
//! rather than starting one. The daemon comes up when the agent's own MCP proxy
//! launches it, which is after TREX has spawned the agent — so a session
//! cannot be created at spawn time, only once the agent has reached the driver.
//!
//! And the driver's `mcp` mode takes no `--session` flag in 0.12.6, so there is
//! no host-side way to bind the agent's proxy to a session id. The agent has to
//! pass `session` per call, which means it has to be told the id. Until that
//! delivery exists, calls arrive session-less and this pinning binds nothing;
//! [`crate::policy`] is then the only guard, and it is written to stand alone
//! for exactly that reason.
