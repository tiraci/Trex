//! Apps an agent may never drive, whatever the user approves.
//!
//! The grant model asks "may *this chat* drive *this process*". Some processes
//! are not a question of which chat: a click into a password manager can reveal
//! every credential the user owns, and a consent card cannot honestly cover it —
//! someone approving "a click" is not approving that.
//!
//! TREX needs this more than a focus-stealing implementation does. When input
//! is delivered by fronting the window, the user watches it happen; the whole
//! point of background delivery is that they do not have to look, which means
//! they also would not see this.
//!
//! **This list is a floor, not a survey.** It cannot enumerate every sensitive
//! app, and it is not a security boundary — an agent with a shell has other
//! routes. It removes the most damaging accident.
//!
//! # The one place Windows is stronger than macOS
//!
//! Windows integrity levels enforce something this list only asks for. UIPI
//! stops a process from sending input to any window owned by a
//! higher-integrity process, in the kernel, with no list to maintain: an
//! unelevated TREX **cannot** inject into an elevated app, whatever the user
//! approves and whatever this table says. The driver surfaces the attempt as a
//! structured `background_uipi_blocked` refusal rather than as a silent
//! no-op — an honest failure, and a rare case of the platform doing this
//! module's job properly.
//!
//! It also means [`crate::proc::executable_of_pid`] returning `None` for an
//! elevated target is the *correct* answer rather than a limitation: TREX
//! could not drive that process anyway. Recorded because both look like bugs
//! to fix, and fixing either would be removing a guarantee.
//!
//! Note what it does *not* cover. Almost everything this list names — password
//! managers, browsers, editors — runs at the same integrity level as TREX,
//! so UIPI has no opinion about them. It raises the floor under elevated
//! processes only, and that is why the table is still the thing doing the work.
