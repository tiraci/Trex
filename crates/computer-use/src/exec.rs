//! Bounded subprocess execution.
//!
//! Every call into the driver goes through here. The driver talks to a daemon
//! that is in turn talking to arbitrary GUI apps, and a hung or modal target is
//! an *expected* state rather than an edge case — a spinning beachball on the
//! app under test must not become a spinning beachball in TREX.
//!
//! Same reasoning as `relay-client`'s `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: the caller may be the
//! GPUI main thread, so an unbounded wait freezes the whole UI. The timeout
//! converts that into a recoverable error.
