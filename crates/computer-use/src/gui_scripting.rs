//! Shell commands that can drive the GUI without going near the driver.
//!
//! # Why a shell tool needs a screen-control policy at all
//!
//! macOS attributes an Accessibility grant to the *responsible* process — the
//! GUI app at the head of the chain — and every descendant inherits it. That was
//! measured on this project rather than assumed: a binary spawned from an
//! agent's shell tool reports `AXIsProcessTrusted() == true`, and `osascript`
//! talking to System Events works from it, *through* an intervening helper
//! process whose entire job is to disclaim responsibility.
//!
//! The grant doing that is not the driver's. `CuaDriver` carries its own TCC
//! identity under launchd, so nothing leaks out of it. The grant that leaks is
//! the one TREX takes for the **Escape kill switch** — an event tap needs
//! Accessibility. So the safety feature is what opens this door, it opens for
//! every project regardless of which ones opted in, and no wrapper process is
//! going to shut it.
//!
//! # On Windows the reasoning above does not apply, and the door is wider
//!
//! Everything in that section is about a *leaking grant*. Windows has no such
//! grant to leak: there is no TCC, nothing to inherit, and no permission
//! attached to synthesizing input. Any unelevated process in the interactive
//! session can call `SendInput`, post window messages, or drive UI Automation
//! against any same-integrity window, always, with nothing asked and nothing
//! recorded.
//!
//! So screen control on Windows is **ambient rather than delegated**, and the
//! conclusion inverts: this brake is not less necessary there because there is
//! no grant, it is *more* necessary, because the reach it slows down was never
//! gated on anything in the first place. An agent's shell has it whether or not
//! the user ever opted in, whether or not the driver is installed, and whether
//! or not this crate exists.
//!
//! The one thing Windows *does* enforce is the integrity boundary — UIPI stops
//! input crossing into a higher-integrity process, in the kernel. That raises
//! the floor under elevated apps and says nothing about the ones that matter
//! here, which run at the same level as TREX. See [`crate::blocked`].
//!
//! ## What that costs in precision
//!
//! macOS has `osascript`: a binary whose whole purpose is automating other
//! apps, so naming it is already most of the signal. Windows has no equivalent.
//! PowerShell is the general-purpose shell *and* the way to P/Invoke
//! `user32.dll`, so the same program name covers `cargo test` and
//! `[User32]::SendInput(…)`.
//!
//! That makes the classifier's job strictly harder and its false-positive cost
//! strictly higher, because Windows agents reach for `pwsh -Command` routinely
//! where macOS agents run a bare binary. The negative tests below are therefore
//! the ones that matter most: a brake that refuses ordinary work is worse than
//! no brake, since it gets switched off.
//!
//! # What this is, and is not
//!
//! It is a brake on the obvious reach. An agent that wants to click something
//! and types `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke …'`
//! gets told to use the screen-control tools, which are governed by the grant
//! table, name their target, and raise a consent card.
//!
//! It is **not** a security boundary, and nothing here should be described as
//! one. The same APIs are three lines of `python3 -c`, or a Swift file compiled
//! on the spot, or a script written to disk and run later. A string classifier
//! cannot see any of that. What it can do is stop the accident and make the
//! deliberate version an obviously deliberate act.
//!
//! Because it is a brake and not a boundary, it errs toward catching things: a
//! command that merely *mentions* System Events alongside an `osascript` call is
//! classified. A false refusal costs the agent one turn and says exactly what to
//! do instead; a false pass is silent.
//!
//! # `-EncodedCommand`, and why it is decoded rather than refused
//!
//! `powershell -EncodedCommand <base64>` hands the shell a UTF-16LE script as
//! one opaque blob. A string classifier cannot read it, and the obvious
//! responses are both bad: refusing every encoded command breaks a legitimate
//! and common way to get past `cmd`'s quoting rules, while ignoring it leaves a
//! trivially-reachable blind spot.
//!
//! So it is neither — the payload is decoded and classified as if it had been
//! written out, which is what it is. Only an *undecodable* payload falls back to
//! [`GuiScripting::OpaqueScript`], and the recursion is depth-limited so a
//! command encoding a command encoding a command terminates.
//!
//! This closes the specific hole. It does not make the module a boundary: the
//! same code still reaches the same APIs from a `.ps1` file, a compiled
//! executable, or a string assembled at runtime from pieces no substring
//! matches. Those are the same limits the macOS half has always had, restated.

/// Why a shell command counts as driving the GUI.
