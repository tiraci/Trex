//! The decision an agent's screen-control call gets.
//!
//! Called synchronously from the permission handler, which is the one place
//! TREX is actually in the path: the driver runs as its own process that the
//! agent talks to directly, so nothing here sits between the agent and the
//! driver. What we get is the `can_use_tool` round-trip, and what we can
//! inspect is exactly the fields present in that call's input JSON.
//!
//! Two shapes of guard, and they are not redundant:
//!
//! - **Tool class** — some tools are refused whatever their arguments, because
//!   what they do cannot be made safe by addressing it correctly (see
//!   [`crate::tools`]).
//! - **Field validation** — for the input tools, the driver leaves `pid`
//!   *optional* and treats its absence as "the frontmost application". A grant
//!   table that only inspects `pid` when `pid` happens to be present enforces
//!   nothing at all, because omitting it is the documented way to target
//!   whatever the user is looking at. So the policy requires what the driver
//!   makes optional.
