//! Supply-chain gate for the third-party driver binary.
//!
//! # Why signature verification rather than a pinned SHA-256
//!
//! The obvious integrity control for a third-party binary is a pinned hash.
//! That is the right answer when the host *downloads* the artifact — it is not
//! the right answer here, and shipping it would have been security theatre:
//!
//! - TREX never downloads the driver. The user installs it, and the driver
//!   ships its own `update --apply` that rewrites the binary in place.
//! - Upstream releases roughly daily. A pinned hash would go stale within days
//!   and turn every legitimate update into "computer use stopped working",
//!   whose only cure is bumping the constant — i.e. exactly the reflexive
//!   hash-bumping that makes a hash pin worthless.
//!
//! The binary is Developer-ID signed and notarized, so a stronger control is
//! available and survives updates:
//!
//! 1. `codesign --verify --strict` — the binary is intact. A tampered copy
//!    exits non-zero.
//! 2. `Identifier` + `TeamIdentifier` — it came from *this* publisher. An
//!    unrelated (even Apple-signed) binary passes step 1 but reports a
//!    different identifier and `TeamIdentifier=not set`, so step 1 alone is
//!    not a gate.
//! 3. Notarization ticket stapled — Apple has seen it.
//!
//! The gates themselves live in `trex-macos-trust` (shared with the app's
//! own updater — forked copies of signature-checking code would drift); this
//! module owns the driver-specific policy, the version floor, and the audit
//! hash.
//!
//! The observed SHA-256 is still computed and reported, so the settings pane
//! and bug reports can state exactly which bytes ran. It is an audit trail,
//! not a gate — the distinction the `dictation` model catalog got wrong when
//! it shipped `archive_sha256: None` and then skipped verification entirely.
