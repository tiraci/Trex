//! Screen control for agents, backed by an external `cua-driver` daemon.
//!
//! # What this crate owns — and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! The driver is a notarized third-party binary the *user* installs. It runs a
//! machine-wide daemon shared with every other MCP client, and it starts that
//! daemon on demand by itself. So this crate:
//!
//! - **verifies** the binary before TREX will declare it to any agent,
//! - **declares** it as an MCP server ([`mcp::server_spec`]),
//! - **reads** daemon state ([`daemon::status`]) without managing it,
//! - **cleans up its own sessions** ([`session::reconcile`]).
//!
//! It does not start, supervise, or reap the daemon. See [`daemon`] for the
//! evidence behind that, which contradicted the original design.
//!
//! Everything here is plain synchronous Rust with no GPUI or async runtime, so
//! it stays unit-testable — but it is intentionally *callable* from the UI
//! thread, because the permission handler that will gate these tools is
//! synchronous. That is what the bounded timeouts in [`exec`] are protecting.
//!
//! # Windows: the gate, and why it is open
//!
//! [`mcp::server_spec`] does not exist on Windows unless the
//! `windows-screen-control` feature is on. The desktop app now enables it, so a
//! Windows build declares the driver like any other — but the feature is kept
//! rather than deleted, because the crate's own tests still build the gated-off
//! shape and because turning it on is a decision about handing agents an
//! unsigned third-party binary. That belongs in a manifest, not buried in a
//! `cfg`. [`declares_driver`] reports which side of it a build is on.
//!
//! The plan this came from called for a crate-wide `compile_error!` instead.
//! That was rejected on contact: it would have made the crate unbuildable on
//! Windows, which also makes it untestable — and the same plan requires the
//! platform-independent modules' tests to pass there. A guard that has to be
//! switched off to run the tests it guards is not a guard.
//!
//! ## Four reasons it stayed shut, and what discharged each
//!
//! Worth keeping, because each was the *whole* answer at the time and three of
//! them turned out to be a layer above the real one.
//!
//! 1. **"No Windows equivalent exists."** Out of date — `cua-driver` has shipped
//!    Windows binaries since v0.1.3.
//! 2. **The policing hook must ship with any screen-driving capability**
//!    (`docs/windows-port-exclusions.md`), since "nothing in the compiler would
//!    say so". Met: [`gui_scripting`] classifies the Windows reach and
//!    `platform::escape_tap` swallows Escape through a `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook.
//!    That condition had in fact been met *before* the driver arrived, because
//!    input synthesis on Windows needs no permission at all.
//! 3. **No trust anchor.** [`verify`]'s model is Apple code signing and the
//!    Windows artifacts are unsigned. Answered by [`trust`]: the user approves
//!    the exact bytes and TREX refuses if they change. A weaker anchor than a
//!    signature, deliberately — it establishes **continuity, not identity**.
//!    Read that module before describing it to a user as verification.
//! 4. **No way to say yes.** An anchor whose approval step has no UI refuses
//!    everything for ever. `settings_modal::pane_driver_trust` is that surface.
//!
//! ## What Windows still does not get
//!
//! Two, both recorded in `docs/windows-port-exclusions.md` rather than hidden:
//!
//! - **No in-app installer.** [`install`] downloads and stages a notarized
//!   `.app`; none of that has a Windows meaning. The user installs the driver
//!   themselves, which is also what makes the trust anchor coherent.
//! - **A weaker "an agent is driving" indicator.** The macOS menu-bar item is
//!   visible the moment it is created; a Windows notification-area icon can sit
//!   in the overflow flyout until the user pins it.
