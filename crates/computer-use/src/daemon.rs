//! Reading daemon state — deliberately *not* controlling it.
//!
//! # TREX does not own the daemon
//!
//! The plan this phase came from assumed TREX would start, supervise, and
//! reap a `cua-driver serve` process on a private socket. Probing the shipped
//! driver showed that is wrong on all three counts, so this module reads state
//! and nothing else. What the driver actually does, verified by running it:
//!
//! - `cua-driver mcp` **starts the daemon itself** when it is not already up,
//!   reporting: "mcp launched without CuaDriver.app's TCC grants; auto-launching
//!   the daemon via `open -n -g -a CuaDriver --args serve`". `-g` keeps it
//!   background, so nothing steals focus.
//! - It launches through LaunchServices *on purpose*. macOS attributes TCC to
//!   the responsible process, and going through `open -a` makes that
//!   `CuaDriver.app` — a stable identity whose Accessibility and Screen
//!   Recording grants survive TREX rebuilds. (The "never launch via `open -a`"
//!   rule applies to the deferred *embedded* mode, where the point is to
//!   inherit TREX's own grants instead.)
//! - The socket is a fixed shared path, not per-host, and the daemon outlives
//!   the `mcp` proxy that started it. It is a machine-wide singleton serving
//!   every MCP client the user has configured.
//!
//! That last point is why there is no reap-on-quit here and no kqueue watch on
//! TREX's pid: killing the daemon on TREX exit would tear the driver out
//! from under the user's other agents. TREX's cleanup obligation is its own
//! *sessions* (see [`crate::session`]), which it can end without touching
//! anyone else's.
//!
//! # On Windows the conclusion survives but the reasoning does not
//!
//! Everything above is argued from TCC. None of that reasoning exists on
//! Windows, and leaving it to stand unqualified would read as an explanation
//! of behaviour it does not explain. What differs:
//!
//! - **There is no LaunchServices hop and no responsible process.** The
//!   `open -n -g -a CuaDriver` dance exists so macOS attributes Accessibility
//!   and Screen Recording to a stable app identity. Windows has no such
//!   attribution, because it has no grant to attribute — input synthesis is
//!   ambient to any process in the interactive session.
//! - **The daemon solves a different problem: Session 0 isolation.** A process
//!   started outside the interactive session (over SSH, from a service) cannot
//!   touch the desktop at all. A daemon living *in* the user's session is how
//!   the driver reaches it, which is a question of where a process lives rather
//!   than of what it is permitted to do.
//! - **The IPC endpoint is a same-user named pipe**, not a `0600` unix socket.
//!   The access-control mechanism is the pipe's ACL rather than file mode bits.
//! - **Auto-start is opt-in and separate.** `cua-driver autostart` is a
//!   Windows-only subcommand registering a logon Scheduled Task. It reports
//!   `not-registered` on a fresh install, so a Windows box has no daemon
//!   running until something starts one.
//!
//! The *conclusion* still holds: TREX does not own the daemon, so it must not
//! reap it. `cua-driver mcp` still starts one when none is up — the CLI
//! documents `--direct` as "own the runtime in this MCP process", which means
//! the default path does not, and describes the compat flag as forwarded "to
//! the proxy-launched daemon (… the path you actually run)".
//!
//! **Not confirmed by running it.** Settling the Windows posture empirically
//! means launching `cua-driver mcp`, which starts a process that can drive the
//! screen; that was left for a deliberate, sighted moment rather than done as a
//! side effect of a spike. Until then this section is read off the driver's own
//! CLI surface, and [`crate::session::reconcile`] must not be simplified on the
//! assumption that sessions die with the proxy.
