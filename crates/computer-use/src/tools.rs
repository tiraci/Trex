//! defeat an input-only grant model outright — a policy that classifies by
//! "does it have a `pid`" would wave them straight through. The table below is
//! transcribed from `cua-driver list-tools` / `describe`, with the quoted
//! phrases that decided each judgement kept next to it.
//!
//! **Unlisted tools are refused.** A future driver release adding a tool must
//! not silently widen what an agent can do; the cost of that choice is that a
//! driver upgrade can refuse something harmless until the table is updated,
//! which is the right way round.
