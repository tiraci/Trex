//! User-anchored trust for a driver binary no publisher will vouch for.
//!
//! # Why this exists alongside [`crate::verify`]
//!
//! [`crate::verify`] gates the driver on Apple code signing: publisher identity,
//! pinned team ID, stapled notarization ticket. That is the strongest control
//! available and it is the one macOS uses.
//!
//! It has no Windows counterpart. Every Windows binary upstream publishes is
//! `NotSigned` — `cua-driver.exe`, `cua-driver-uia.exe`, `cua_driver_sdk.dll` —
//! there is no GitHub build provenance to fall back on (the attestations
//! endpoint 404s), and their own `install.ps1` verifies neither a checksum nor a
//! signature. There is no subject to pin.
//!
//! So Windows cannot ask "did the publisher sign this?" and gets the only other
//! question that has an answer: **"are these the exact bytes the user
//! approved?"**
//!
//! # What this buys, stated precisely
//!
//! It is trust-on-first-use, anchored on a human rather than a certificate
//! authority. Be exact about the two halves, because overselling this is how it
//! becomes worse than nothing:
//!
//! - **It does not establish identity.** Nothing here can tell an authentic
//!   `cua-driver.exe` from a hostile one the user was tricked into installing.
//!   If the first approval is of a bad binary, this pins the bad binary. Any UI
//!   built on it must say "unverified publisher" and must not say "verified".
//! - **It does establish continuity.** Once approved, the bytes cannot change
//!   without the user being asked again. That is the realistic threat against a
//!   long-lived install — something rewriting the binary in place months later,
//!   which is precisely what an unsigned auto-updating tool invites.
//!
//! The trust decision moves to the person who can actually make it: they choose
//! the install route, and TREX enforces what they chose.
//!
//! # The pin is on the bytes, not the path
//!
//! Moving an approved driver keeps it approved; rewriting one in place does not.
//! That is the correct axis when there is no publisher — the bytes *are* the
//! identity, so they are what gets pinned.
//!
//! The cost is real and worth stating plainly: **the driver self-updates**
//! (`update --apply` rewrites the binary in place), and upstream ships roughly
//! six releases a week. Every one of those invalidates the pin and asks the user
//! again. That is not a flaw to be smoothed over — with no publisher signature,
//! a new binary genuinely is a new trust decision, and quietly accepting it
//! would discard the only guarantee this module provides. What the UI may do is
//! make re-approval one click; what it may not do is skip it.
//!
//! # Never execute what has not been approved
//!
//! [`TrustStore::evaluate`] reads and hashes the file. It does not run it, and
//! callers must not run it either until the verdict is [`Trust::Approved`].
//! This is why the version floor is checked *after* approval rather than before:
//! reading `--version` means executing the binary, which is the one thing an
//! unapproved binary must not get to do. The approval prompt therefore shows a
//! path, a size, and a hash — never a version, because learning the version
//! costs exactly what the prompt exists to withhold.
