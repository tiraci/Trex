//! Resolve a pid to the executable behind it.
//!
//! A grant is recorded against a pid, but a pid is a recycled integer: the
//! process that owned it can exit and a completely different program can be
//! handed the same number. So the grant records the *executable path* too, and
//! every later use re-resolves the pid and compares. That narrows the reuse
//! window to the gap between our check and the driver's own resolution on the
//! far side of its socket — it does not close it, and nothing on this side can
//! (see [`crate::grants`]).
//!
//! macOS: `proc_pidpath` fills a buffer with the absolute path of a pid's
//! executable. Declared directly rather than via a crate, matching how
//! `trex-proc-cwd` handles the neighbouring `proc_pidinfo` call.
//!
//! Windows: `QueryFullProcessImageNameW` against a handle opened with
//! `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION` — the least-privileged right that still
//! answers this question, and the one an unelevated process can obtain against
//! same-integrity targets.
//!
//! A higher-integrity target (anything elevated) refuses the open and resolves
//! to `None`. That is the **correct** answer rather than a limitation to work
//! around: TREX could not drive such a process anyway, because UIPI blocks
//! input injection across the integrity boundary. A `None` here and a refusal
//! there are the same fact reaching the user twice, which is why the contract
//! above says `None` means refuse.
