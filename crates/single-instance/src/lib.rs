//! Which process owns a per-data-directory role, decided by an advisory lock.
//!
//! Two TREX processes pointed at the same on-disk data directory must not
//! both perform certain roles: two GUI instances race the per-window layout
//! store and both attach the same relay PTYs, and two schedule tickers would
//! double-fire every due schedule. This crate answers "who owns the role" with
//! a non-blocking exclusive lock (`flock` on unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows,
//! both via `fd-lock`) on a role-named file in the data directory, held for
//! the process lifetime by keeping the open file alive inside the returned
//! guard. The OS releases it when the process exits — including a crash or
//! SIGKILL — so a dead holder never strands a stale lock, which is the failure
//! mode a bare pidfile has.
//!
//! What a contender does about a live holder is the caller's business: the GUI
//! brings the holder's window forward and exits, the schedule ticker declines
//! to tick and keeps serving everything else.
