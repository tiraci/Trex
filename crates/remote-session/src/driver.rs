//! The connection maintainer: dials via a [`Connector`], establishes a session,
//! hands it to the app, and — when the link drops — reconnects per the
//! [`Reconnect`] policy (backing off through an injected [`Sleeper`]) until it
//! succeeds or the budget is spent.
//!
//! Runtime-agnostic and spawn-free: the demux pump is inlined into the maintain
//! future via `select`, so a plain executor drives it in tests and any runtime
//! hosts it in prod. A **lost link is observed as the pump future completing** —
//! the same signal the demux uses for host-close — so no separate liveness ping is
//! needed. `on_connected` hands the live [`RemoteSession`] to the app; the app's
//! RPCs are serviced because the pump keeps being polled inside this future until
//! the link drops or `shutdown` fires.
