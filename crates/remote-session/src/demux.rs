//! The multiplexed client connection: a single read loop (the "pump") that
//! demuxes the host's frames — pushed [`Response::Event`]s go to the live event
//! stream, every other reply goes to the outstanding RPC — so a client can issue
//! RPCs *while* subscribed to a live session, all over one transport.
//!
//! The wire carries no per-request correlation id: replies come back in send
//! order. So RPCs are **serialized** (one outstanding at a time, `rpc_lock`) and
//! the pump routes the next non-event frame to the single pending reply slot.
//! Events are distinguished purely by variant and never consume the reply slot,
//! so they interleave freely between an RPC's request and its reply.
