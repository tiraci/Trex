//! The client session: the Register/Connect/AuthProve handshake and the one-shot
//! RPCs, driven over the `remote-proto` [`Transport`] seam. Pure Rust — the iroh
//! transport is injected as one `Transport` impl, and the in-memory loopback
//! drives the full-loop test against the real host dispatcher.
//!
//! Every RPC rides the concurrent [`demux`](crate::demux) pump, so a client can
//! issue requests *while* subscribed to a live session on the same connection: the
//! pump routes pushed `HostEvent`s to the event stream ([`Self::take_events`]) and
//! each reply to its waiting caller. The reconnect state machine is a later slice.
