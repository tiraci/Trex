//! The dial seam: how the reconnect driver obtains a fresh transport to the host.
//!
//! Each (re)connect attempt asks the [`Connector`] for a new [`Transport`]. The
//! production impl is an iroh endpoint dial — a fresh QUIC bi-stream with a fresh
//! pkarr resolve every attempt, so a moved/renumbered host is re-found on retry;
//! tests use the in-memory loopback. Keeping the dial behind a trait is what lets
//! the reconnect policy ([`crate::reconnect`]) and its driver stay transport- and
//! network-agnostic.
