//! The terminal RPCs: list, attach, type, resize, detach.
//!
//! Attaching returns only the replay snapshot. The live frames that follow
//! arrive on the connection's terminal stream ([`RemoteSession::take_terminals`])
//! rather than being returned here, because they are *pushed* — the pump routes
//! them off the reply path, exactly as it does session events, so an RPC issued
//! while a terminal is streaming still gets its own answer back.
