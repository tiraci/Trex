//! What a new worktree is cut from — and what that choice implies for
//! provisioning.
//!
//! Before this existed, `git worktree add -b <branch> <path>` ran with no
//! start-point, so every worktree branched off whatever the main checkout's
//! HEAD happened to be. Creating a worktree while sitting on a half-finished
//! feature branch silently based the new work on it, and the user found out
//! at review time.
//!
//! The two modes are an enum rather than two optional strings because the
//! fourth state — "adopt an existing branch, and also cut it from somewhere" —
//! is not a thing, and a pair of `Option`s would let a caller build it.

///
/// - No base was named (`NewBranch { from: None }`) → the default branch, or

///   (`main`, `origin/main`, `refs/remotes/upstream/main`) → reviewed by
///   definition. See [`is_the_default_branch`] for why this matters more than
///   it looks.
/// - The named base is an ancestor of the default branch → already in the

///
/// An earlier draft treated "we could not establish ancestry" as "provision
/// normally", on the reasoning that inventing a refusal from ignorance is
/// rude. That reasoning is wrong here, and the asymmetry is why: failing
/// closed costs the user one click (`Run setup`), while failing open runs a
/// script from a ref they have not read, as them, unattended. A repository
/// with no discoverable default branch — no `origin/HEAD`, no local
/// `main`/`master` — is not exotic, and it is precisely the case where we know
