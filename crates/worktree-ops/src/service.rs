//! Serving worktree create/list/remove to an authorized client — the host's
//! implementation of remote-host's [`WorktreeService`] seam.
//!
//! Reuses the New-Worktree flow's own pieces rather than paralleling them: the
//! same slug validation, the same [`create_workspace_with_rollback`] (git
//! worktree + branch + DB row, with rollback on storage failure), and the same
//! pre-remove cleanup script. A worktree the CLI creates is therefore exactly
//! the row the desktop sidebar lists, and vice versa.
//!
//! **The path scheme here is host-derived, unconditionally.** This service
//! constructs its own [`HostDerivedLocator`] and takes no locator from a
//! caller, so a client names a project and a slug and never a location — the
//! property the remote surface promises, kept even now that the desktop's own
//! creates resolve a configured root.
//!
//! No view state anywhere: everything here is durable data plus git
//! subprocesses, which is what lets `TREX serve` host it unchanged. The
//! desktop sidebar picks up remotely-created rows on its next rebuild (project
//! switch or restart), the same way it absorbs changes from another window.
