//! `.TREXinclude` — copying a project's untracked local files into a fresh
//! worktree.
//!
//! A git worktree gets every *tracked* file for free and none of the untracked
//! ones. That is correct for git and useless for the user: the `.env`, the dev
//! certs, and the local overrides that the setup script and the app both need
//! stay behind in the main checkout. `.TREXinclude` is the project's
//! declaration of which of those a worktree cannot work without.
//!
//! It is committed, so it names *paths*, never secrets — the files it points at
//! are the untracked ones, and they are copied, not listed.
//!
//! # Supported syntax
//!
//! One pattern per line; blank lines and `#` comments ignored; a leading `!`
//! negates. Paths are relative to the project root. Matching is real gitignore
//! semantics (via the `ignore` crate), so `*.pem`, `certs/`, and `config/*.local`
//! all mean what they mean in a `.gitignore`.
//!
//! The one deliberate departure: a pattern is **anchored at its literal
//! prefix**. `certs/*.pem` scans `certs/` rather than the whole repo, and only
//! a pattern that begins with a wildcard (`*.pem`, `**/x`) scans from the root.
//! Gitignore has no such notion because git is matching paths it already
//! walked; here the walk is the expensive part, and an unanchored scan of a
//! repo with a `node_modules` in it is the difference between instant and
//! minutes. A root-anchored scan is still bounded by [`SCAN_BUDGET`] and
//! reports when it hits it, so the pathological case is a visible skip rather
//! than a worktree creation that appears to hang.
//!
//! # The copy contract
//!
//! Each clause below has its own test, because the two symlink clauses are a
//! security boundary rather than a nicety: a copy that dereferences a source
//! symlink, or writes through one in the target, writes outside the worktree.
//!
//! 1. Regular files are copied. Directories are copied recursively.
//! 2. A path that already exists in the worktree wins and the skip is reported
//!    — a tracked file is never overwritten by an include.
//! 3. A source symlink is skipped, never dereferenced.
//! 4. An existing symlink anywhere in the target path is refused, so a copy
//!    can never be redirected outside the worktree.
//! 5. A pattern that matches nothing is reported, and the copy continues.
//! 6. An unreadable source or a failed write is reported, and the copy
//!    continues.
//!
//! Nothing here fails provisioning. A missing `.env` is worth telling the user
//! about; it is not worth destroying the worktree they asked for. The setup
//! script — which *can* fail creation — is the thing that decides whether the
//! files it needed were actually there.
