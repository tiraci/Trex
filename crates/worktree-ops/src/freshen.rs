//! Bring the local default branch up to date before branching off it.
//!
//! A worktree is created from whatever HEAD happens to be, so a default branch
//! last pulled a week ago gives the new worktree a week-old base. Turning this
//! on makes creation fetch and fast-forward first.
//!
//! **What that does and does not reach.** `git worktree add -b <branch> <path>`
//! takes no start point, so the new branch is cut from HEAD. When the main
//! checkout is sitting on the default branch — the usual state for a
//! worktree-driven workflow, where the root stays on `main` and the work
//! happens elsewhere — the fast-forward moves HEAD, and the new worktree does
//! start from the freshened commit. When HEAD is on some other branch, this
//! updates the local default *ref* and the new worktree is still cut from
//! HEAD, unchanged. Choosing the start point explicitly is Phase 2's job, not
//! this setting's.
//!
//! **Every refusal is silent and normal.** This runs on the create path, where
//! the user asked for a worktree and not for a sync — so a dirty tree, a
//! local-only commit, a repository with no remote, or a network that is not
//! there must all leave creation completely unaffected. There is exactly one
//! success case and every other outcome is [`Freshened::Skipped`], carrying the
//! reason for the log and nothing else.
//!
//! **Never merges, never forces.** The only mutating commands are
//! `merge --ff-only` and `fetch <remote> <branch>:<branch>`, and git itself
//! refuses both when the move is not a fast-forward. The ancestry check below
//! is a cheap way to skip early with a legible reason, not the safety net —
//! the safety net is git's.
