//! The one place a [`GitSettings`] and a slug become a branch name.
//!
//! Five sites used to write `format!("TREX/{slug}")` — the git layer, this
//! crate's create path, the workspace dialog's preview, the chat pill's
//! preview, and the chat pill's actual create. A sixth arrived with rename.
//! Six copies of a rule is six chances for the preview to promise one branch
//! and the create to make another, and the user only finds out afterwards, in
//! `git branch`.
//!
//! **Why here and not in `trex-settings`.** Resolving
//! [`BranchPrefixMode::GitUsername`] means running `git config user.name`.
//! `trex-settings` has no git dependency and must not gain one: it is on
//! `trex-cli`'s dependency path, and pulling the git process layer through
//! that edge is the coupling `trex-worktree-ops` was extracted to avoid.
//! Spawning a bare `std::process::Command` from the settings crate instead
//! would dodge `GitCmd` — and with it `no_window`, flashing a console on
//! Windows. So the serde shape lives there and the resolution lives here,
//! in a crate that already depends on both.
