//! The worktree lifecycle, shared by every host.
//!
//! A worktree is three things that must agree: a git worktree on disk, the
//! branch it checks out, and the `workspaces` row that names both. That branch
//! used to be `TREX/<slug>` by construction; it is now whatever the row
//! records, because a worktree may be cut on a configured prefix or may adopt
//! an existing branch outright (see [`CreateBase`]).
//! [`create_workspace_with_rollback`] is what keeps them in agreement when the
//! third step fails after the first two succeeded, and it is the reason this
//! module exists as one implementation rather than two.
//!
//! Where a worktree goes is a [`WorktreeLocator`]'s answer, and so is whether
//! a directory already there may be cleared as debris. The remote surface
//! keeps the host-derived scheme — a client names a project and a slug, never
//! a location — through [`HostDerivedLocator`]; the desktop, which is the
//! host, resolves a configured, browsable root instead. See [`locator`].

/// rule and every degradation in it.
///
/// # Preconditions
///
/// The caller MUST have established that no workspace row references
/// `worktree_path`. Given that, a directory already at `worktree_path` that
/// the locator minted is debris from an interrupted create and is cleared
/// before the git step — see [`reclaim_orphan`].
///
/// # Provisioning
///
/// Between the git step and the DB insert, [`Provision`] runs two things that
/// make the difference between a worktree that exists and one the user can work
/// in: the `.trexinclude` copy, then the project's `setup` script. The order
/// is fixed — setup scripts read the files the include brings.
///
/// The insert deliberately happens *after* both. A row written before setup
/// would have to be deleted when setup fails, which is a fourth rollback step
/// and a fourth way to leave the three artifacts disagreeing. Provisioning
/// after the row exists would be worse still: the sidebar would list a
/// half-built worktree. As written, a setup failure unwinds through the
/// rollback ladder that was already here for the storage case.
