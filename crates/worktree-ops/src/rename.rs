//! Renaming a workspace: the branch, the directory and the row, or none of them.
//!
//! A rename is the second operation in this crate that mutates three things
//! which must agree, and it follows the same shape as
//! [`create_workspace_with_rollback`](crate::create_workspace_with_rollback):
//! this module owns the ordering and the undo, so no host has to reimplement
//! either.
//!
//! Ordering is the whole design. `git worktree move` is the step that can
//! half-fail; `git branch -m` is cheap and exactly reversible. So the move goes
//! first and the branch second, and a failure at the branch step walks the move
//! back. The row is written last, because a row is the one thing that can be
//! rewritten with no filesystem consequence at all.
//!
//! Every refusal is checked *before* anything is touched. A refusal discovered
//! after a partial move is the failure mode this module exists to design out.
