//! Codenames: the name a workspace gets when the user does not type one.
//!
//! The create dialog no longer insists on a name, because naming the work
//! before knowing what it is was the step that made "one keystroke to a
//! worktree" impossible. An empty name gets a codename from the list below,
//! and the branch and directory are cut on it exactly as they would be on a
//! typed name.
//!
//! The list is deliberately boring. These words appear in branch names, in
//! pull-request titles and in `git worktree list` output of a public
//! repository, so they are short, neutral, natural-material nouns with no
//! theme and no joke in them. Anything whimsical becomes a support question.
//!
//! Recognising a codename later is derived, not stored: a slug is one this
//! module produced iff, with any `-N` uniquing suffix stripped, it is a member
//! of the list. That is checkable at any time, survives a database restore,
//! and cannot desynchronise from reality the way a boolean column can. The
//! cost is that a user who types a word from the list gets a workspace
//! indistinguishable from a generated one — accepted, and the reason the list
//! is boring.
