//! Running a project's `setup` script as part of worktree provisioning.
//!
//! This is the inverse of [`crate::run_cleanup_before_remove`] in the one way
//! that matters. Cleanup must never trap the user: a teardown script that
//! fails, hangs, or does not exist is logged and the removal proceeds anyway.
//! Setup is the opposite — a worktree whose dependencies did not install is not
//! a worktree the user can work in, and reporting it as created is the lie this
//! phase exists to stop telling. So a non-zero exit, a timeout, or a failure to
//! start each fail creation and roll the worktree back.
//!
//! Everything else is deliberately the same shape as cleanup — `sh -lc`, cwd at
//! the worktree, `no_window` so Windows shows no console flash, `kill_on_drop`
//! so the timeout escape actually kills the child rather than orphaning it.
//! The two differences from cleanup are both consequences of failure mattering:
//!
//! - **Output is captured, not discarded.** Cleanup throws its output away
//!   because nothing can act on it. Here the user needs to read the compiler
//!   error, so stdout and stderr stream into a transcript as they arrive.
//! - **stdin is closed.** A setup script that prompts (`npm login`, a
//!   passphrase) would otherwise block until [`SETUP_TIMEOUT`] with no
//!   indication why. With stdin at `/dev/null` it fails immediately and the
//!   transcript shows the prompt it died on.
