//! Where a host puts a new worktree — and whether it may clear what it finds
//! there.
//!
//! The path scheme used to be one function, [`worktree_path`], and one
//! sentence of doctrine: *a client names a project and a slug, never a
//! location*. That sentence is a security property of the **remote** surface,
//! and it still holds — [`HostDerivedLocator`] is that derivation, and the RPC
//! service constructs it itself. But it was never a law for the desktop, which
//! is the host, and whose worktrees ended up under an opaque project UUID in
//! Application Support where no one could find them.
//!
//! So the seam is a trait rather than a config flag. A locator answers two
//! questions that must come from the same place:
//!
//! - [`WorktreeLocator::locate`] — where this slug's worktree goes.
//! - [`WorktreeLocator::may_reclaim`] — whether a directory already at some
//!   path is debris this locator's own interrupted create left behind.
//!
//! **The second is the invariant of this module.** Orphan reclaim is a
//! delete, and the only thing that makes it safe is that it targets a path
//! *this locator minted for this slug* — never a directory a person chose. The
//! answer is per path and per slug; a locator that answered from its own kind
//! (`true` for host-derived, `false` for configured) would either delete a
//! user's directory or leave an interrupted create wedged forever, and both
//! have happened in the design of this crate.
