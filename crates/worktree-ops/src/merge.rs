//! Landing a worktree's branch in the project's default branch.
//!
//! **`merge_branch(x)` merges `x` into the repository it is called on.** So
//! landing worktree `feat-x` means opening a `Repository` at the *project
//! root* and merging `TREX/feat-x` into it. Opening the worktree instead
//! would merge main into the feature branch — plausible, silent and backwards.
//! That is why [`preflight_merge`] takes the project root explicitly and this
//! module never derives a repository from a workspace row.
//!
//! This is the most destructive operation the worktree crate offers: it mutates
//! the main checkout, which the user may be looking at, and `merge_branch`
//! auto-stashes that checkout when it is dirty. Every refusal below exists to
//! keep the user from discovering that after the fact.
//!
//! **The pre-flight is advice, not a lock.** Every check is a read, and the
//! merge that follows is unsynchronized: HEAD can move between the two.
//! [`apply_merge`] re-reads HEAD and the operation sentinels immediately before
//! merging and aborts if either changed, which closes the window that matters
//! cheaply. A full repository lock is out of scope for a single-user v1; that
//! is a decision, not an omission.
