//! Integration tests for `freshen_default_branch` — real `git` binary in a
//! tempdir, same style as `workspace_merge.rs`.
//!
//! The interesting property is not that the fast-forward works; it is that
//! **every other path leaves the repository untouched**. This runs on the
//! create path, where the user asked for a worktree and not for a sync, so a
//! skip is the correct outcome for a dirty tree, a local-only commit, a
//! missing remote, and an unreachable one. Each of those has its own test, and
//! each asserts the local sha did not move.
