// Bumped whenever the wire schema changes in a non-additive way. The
// socket path also embeds a version (`relay-v<N>.sock`) so mismatched
// major builds can't even reach the handshake; this constant is the
// failsafe for the case where an old client somehow finds a newer
// daemon's socket (dev environments).
//
// v4: multi-client attach — `attachment_id` added to `AttachOk`/`SpawnOk`
// (so each attachment is individually addressable) and to `Resize` (the
// daemon recomputes the effective PTY size as the element-wise `min`
// across attachments, "smallest screen wins"); `Request::Detach` lets one
// attachment drop out without killing the PTY.
//
// v5: `Request::Spawn` carries `args` (the program's argv) so an agent
// launch can pass its flags directly — the daemon runs `program args…` as
// the PTY leaf, with no login-shell `exec` wrapper echoing a command line.
// Bincode isn't self-describing, so the added field is a wire break: the
// socket name bumps to `relay-v5.sock`, a fresh client spawns a fresh
// daemon, and any stale v4 daemon idles out on its own socket.
//
// v6: `Request::AgentStatus` lets a child process (an agent CLI hook,
// invoked via `TREX agent-status`) report structured status. The daemon
// frames the opaque payload as an OSC-9999 sequence and fans it out on the
// PTY's existing output channel, so the app's status scanner decodes it
// with no new app-side plumbing — and an agent hook can report status
// without a controlling terminal (hooks run detached, with no `/dev/tty`).
// New variant ⇒ wire break ⇒ socket bumps to `relay-v6.sock`.
//
// v7: `Notification::Gapped` tells a subscriber the daemon discarded output
// for it, so it knows to re-attach and resync from the replay ring. The
// version bump is load-bearing rather than ceremonial: the handshake compares
// versions for EQUALITY, so without it a v7 daemon and a v6 client would
// connect happily and then break the moment a gap occurred — the v6 client
// cannot decode variant 3, and postcard enums are positional. Bumping turns
// that into a clean refusal at connect. Socket bumps to `relay-v7.sock`.
//
// Also v7 (same unreleased break): `Request::Replay` / `Response::ReplayOk`
// re-fetch the ring WITHOUT minting an attachment, so recovering from a gap
// does not add a second attachment whose stale size would keep voting in the
// daemon's smallest-screen-wins `min`.
// v8: the handshake stops putting the token on the wire. `Hello` carries a
// client nonce instead, the daemon answers with `HelloChallenge` (its own nonce
// plus a proof that it holds the token), and the client answers that with
// `HelloProof`. Both proofs cover both nonces — see `crate::auth` for why each
// piece is there. Wire break in both directions, so the endpoint bumps to
// `relay-v8`.
//
// v9: per-subscriber notifications carry the `attachment_id` they were fanned
// to. The daemon already sent one copy per attachment, but `Output`/`Exit`/
// `Gapped` named only the PTY — so a client holding two attachments to one PTY
// (a desktop pane plus a remote peer watching the same terminal) received two
// identical notifications over its one connection and had no way to tell them
// apart. It delivered both to every local subscriber, and each rendered every
// byte twice. Addressing the notification is what makes the client's routing
// exact. Field added to three variants ⇒ wire break ⇒ socket bumps to
// `relay-v9`.
