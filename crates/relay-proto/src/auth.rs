//! The proofs both ends of the relay connection exchange instead of the token.
//!
//! A unix-domain socket sits in a directory only this account can enter, so
//! whoever answers it is this account. `\\.\pipe\` is one flat namespace and
//! pipe *creation* needs no privilege, so the name the client dials can be
//! claimed by a process that got there first — and the relay's own
//! `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE` does not help the client here: it makes the
//! *real* daemon fail to start, which leaves the squatter holding the name the
//! GUI is about to dial.
//!
//! A squatter that receives the token gets to impersonate the relay for the
//! rest of the session — every byte the user sees in a terminal would be
//! attacker-authored. So the token never goes on the wire. Each side proves it
//! knows the token by MACing a pair of nonces, one chosen by each end:
//!
//! - both nonces are covered, so neither proof can be replayed into a later
//!   connection (a recorded proof is bound to nonces that will not recur);
//! - the two directions use different domain prefixes, so a proof harvested
//!   from one side cannot be echoed back as the other's;
//! - the server proves itself *first*. It cannot produce that proof without the
//!   token, so a squatter is caught before the client has revealed anything at
//!   all — the client simply hangs up.
//!
//! Neither the token nor either proof identifies a *process*, so this says
//! nothing about which program is on the far end beyond "it can read a file
//! only this account can read". That is the same statement the unix socket
//! makes, which is the bar being restored here rather than raised.
