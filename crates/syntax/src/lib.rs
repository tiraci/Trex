//! Syntax highlighting as *neutral kinds*, not colors.
//!
//! One highlighter for every code surface TREX draws, emitting
//! [`HighlightKind`] spans that a theme resolves to colors at paint time.
//!
//! ## The discipline (the part that matters more than the code)
//!
//! > Do not add language-specific parsing to a renderer. Unknown languages,
//! > binaries, oversized sources, incompatible grammars and parse failures must
//! > remain **plain**. Highlighting changes foreground color **only** — never
//! > font, weight, style, wrapping, height, or scroll geometry.
//!
//! That last clause is what makes highlighting safe to compute lazily and
//! off-thread: if it cannot change layout, it can arrive late without reflowing
//! anything. Every degradation path in this crate returns plain rather than an
//! error, for the same reason.
//!
//! ## Why colors live outside
//!
//! The path this replaces copied literal sRGB out of a bundled theme into each
//! token. That made a color change a *re-tokenization* — and tied the palette to
//! a `.tmTheme` file rather than to TREX's own theme. Kinds are stable facts
//! about the source; colors are a preference. Separating them means an
//! appearance change recolors existing spans with no parsing at all.
//!
//! ## No UI toolkit
//!
//! Enforced in CI, not by convention. It is what lets this crate be tested in
//! isolation.
//!
//! ```
//! use trex_syntax::{HighlightKind, detect, highlight};
//!
//! let lang = detect(None, Some("rust"), "").expect("rust is a known fence tag");
//! let doc = highlight(&lang, "let x = 1; // note\n");
//!
//! let kinds: Vec<_> = doc.line(0).iter().map(|s| s.kind).collect();
//! assert!(kinds.contains(&HighlightKind::Keyword));
//! assert!(kinds.contains(&HighlightKind::Comment));
//! ```
