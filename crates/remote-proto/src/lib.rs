//! Remote-control wire protocol shared by the TREX desktop host and the
//! phone's Rust core.
//!
//! Three concerns:
//! - [`proto`] — the append-only RPC envelope (`Request`/`Response`), the
//!   [`HostEvent`](proto::HostEvent) stream frame, and their postcard codec.
//! - [`pairing`] — the [`PairingTicket`](pairing::PairingTicket) a QR carries
//!   and the `TREX://connect?ticket=` URL helpers.
//! - [`transport`] — the [`Transport`](transport::Transport) trait the dispatcher
//!   speaks over, so iroh is one impl and an in-memory loopback drives tests.
//!
//! **Wire codec = postcard** (compact, non-self-describing). The envelope is
//! versioned and extended by appending variants — never by reordering or
//! removing them (postcard encodes enums by ordinal), mirroring the relay
//! protocol's [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`](proto::PROTOCOL_VERSION) discipline.
//!
//! **Why event/decision payloads ride as JSON strings:** `ThreadEvent` and
//! `PermissionDecision` carry `serde_json::Value` (arbitrary tool input/output).
//! postcard cannot deserialize a `Value` — it is non-self-describing, so
//! `Value`'s `deserialize_any` fails with `WontImplement`. Rather than fork a
//! shadow event type (and rather than string-wrapping the shared types, which
//! would silently change their already-shipped persisted JSON format), the
//! envelope carries these payloads as a `serde_json` string. JSON is
//! self-describing, handles `Value` natively, and is already the persistence
//! representation, so encoding is reused rather than reinvented.
