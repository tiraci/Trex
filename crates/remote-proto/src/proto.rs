/// full history even after a host restart (the restored transcript never enters
/// the live event ring). v14: appended `ListProjects` and its `Projects` reply —
/// the host's projects (name + path) so a client can start a session in one
/// without typing its path. v15: appended `Unpair` — a device drops its own
/// enrollment, so forgetting a desktop on the phone also clears the phone from

/// needs (`PairNew`/`PairList`/`PairRemove` and the `PairingIssued`/
/// `PairedDeviceList` replies) — runtime commands, never boot flags, so a
/// bearer ticket is minted on demand instead of reprinted into a journal.
/// v17: appended `RunScheduleNow` (a manual fire that never advances cadence
/// accounting) with its `ScheduleRunRecorded` reply, and the
/// `ScheduleRunsChanged` push — a recorded schedule run delivered to
/// session-list subscribers so run results arrive without polling. The push is
/// gated host-side on the peer having declared ≥ v17
/// ([`SCHEDULE_PUSH_MIN_VERSION`]): unlike a new *reply* (only sent to a peer
/// that asked), a push reaches peers that never opted in, and an older decoder
/// meeting the unknown ordinal would drop the whole connection.
///
/// v18: appended the automation surface — **heartbeats** (`CreateHeartbeat`,
/// `ListHeartbeats`, `DeleteHeartbeat` and the `Heartbeats` reply), a session's
/// own recurring wake-ups, which are schedules aimed at an existing session
/// rather than at a fresh spawn; **team runs** (`TeamRunCreate`, `TeamReport`,
/// `TeamStatus`, `TeamList` and the `TeamRun`/`TeamRuns` replies), a restart-
/// surviving record of a multi-role fan-out; and the **coordination state KV**
/// (`StateGet`, `StateSet`, `StateDelete`, `StateWatch` with the `StateValue`/
/// `StateSnapshot`/`StateChanged`/`StateConflict` frames), a small versioned
/// blackboard agents share without going through a transcript.
///
/// Heartbeats get their own list verb and their own `HeartbeatWire` rather than
/// riding [`Response::Schedules`]: `ScheduleWire` is a postcard struct, so it
/// is as positional as an enum and a field appended to it would misparse every
/// element after the first on an older client. The same reasoning keeps
/// heartbeats out of `ListSchedules` entirely — a v17 phone must not receive
/// rows whose target it has no field to see.
///
/// v19: appended the **coordination watch cursor** (`StateWatchFrom` with the
/// `StateWatchStarted`/`StateChangedAt` frames). v18's `StateWatch` answers the
/// board and then pushes every change, which is enough to stay current but not
/// to know whether you *are*: a watcher whose connection dropped, or whose
/// receiver lagged, got no signal that it had missed transitions, and the
/// stream carried no position it could resume from. The cursor version replays
/// the gap when the host's ring still covers it and otherwise resyncs with a
/// fresh baseline — the same "recover, and say so" contract session events have
/// had since v1, rather than silent staleness.
///
/// `StateWatch` is untouched and still served: a v18 peer keeps working exactly
/// as before, and gets the cursor-less push it has a decoder for.
///
/// v22: appended **per-role agents in a team run** (`TeamRunCreateV2` and
/// `TeamStatusV2`, answered by `TeamRunV2`). v18 put one `--agent` on the whole
/// run because that is what the launcher took; the loop teams are built around
/// is one agent planning while another implements, which makes the choice a
/// property of the role. New verbs and new wire types rather than fields on the
/// v18 ones, for the reason stated on `ListWorktreeProgress`: everything in
/// `TeamRunCreateReq.roles` and `TeamRunWire.roles` is a positional postcard
/// struct a v18 CLI already sends and decodes. The v18 verbs are untouched and
/// still served.
///
/// v23: appended **cron schedules** (`CreateScheduleV2` and `ListSchedulesV2`,
/// answered by `ScheduleCreatedV2` / `SchedulesV2`). The three preset
/// recurrences cannot say "weekdays at 09:00", which until now needed a
/// heartbeat workaround. New verbs and a new `RecurrenceV2Wire` rather than a
/// fourth variant on `RecurrenceWire`, and here the reason is sharper than
/// usual: `RecurrenceWire` rides inside `Vec<ScheduleWire>` *replies* as well as
/// inside `CreateSchedule`, so a fourth ordinal would make one cron schedule
/// render every `ListSchedules` reply undecodable for a pre-v23 peer — every
/// row, not just the cron one. The v18 verbs are untouched and still served;
/// a cron schedule reaches them as the stand-in documented on
/// `ScheduleWire::recurrence`. Heartbeats are deliberately not included: nothing
/// asks for a cron heartbeat, and leaving them out means `HeartbeatWire` needs
/// no degradation path at all.
///
/// v24: appended **base refs on worktree creation** (`CreateWorktreeV2`,
/// answered by the existing `WorktreeCreated`). Every worktree used to branch
/// off whatever the main checkout's HEAD happened to be, which silently based
/// new work on a half-finished feature branch. A new verb rather than a field
/// on ordinal 43 for the usual reason, sharpened by postcard's non-descriptive
/// framing: an appended `Option` costs a byte even when `None`, so a v24 client
/// making a *plain* create would become undecodable to every v23 host — the
/// common case broken by the rare one. `CreateWorktree` is untouched and still
/// served, and the client gates on which verb to send. The V2 verb also carries
/// a narrower authorization than its payload alone implies: see
/// [`Request::CreateWorktreeV2`].
///
/// Appending variants is *not* a breaking change — postcard ordinals of the
/// existing ones are untouched, and an older peer simply never sends or receives

/// (`remote_iroh::TREX_ALPN`) deliberately does not: that tracks breaking
