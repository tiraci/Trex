//! `EditorView` — per-file viewer that renders one of three modes:
//!
//! - `Text` — gpui-component `code_editor` `InputState` with tree-sitter
//!   highlighting, soft-wrap, LSP hover, diagnostics. The primary path.
//! - `Image` — GPUI `img(path)` element centered with letterbox. Drawn for
//!   PNG/JPG/GIF/WEBP/BMP/ICO/SVG (anything `image_mime_for_path` accepts).
//! - `Binary` — centered "Binary file — cannot display" placeholder.
//!
//! Mode is decided once at construction by sniffing the file bytes:
//! `binary::is_binary_buffer` for the NUL-byte heuristic, then a UTF-8
//! round-trip check on top to catch encodings (UTF-16BE, latin-1) that
//! lack interior NULs in their ASCII range but still fail to decode. The
//! decision is *not* extension-driven for text-vs-binary so a file named
//! `data.txt` containing a PNG header still rejects gracefully.
//!
//! LSP-related state lives only on the `Text` variant — `attach_lsp` is a
//! no-op for `Image`/`Binary` and `state()` returns `None` so callers can
//! cleanly skip provider installs.
