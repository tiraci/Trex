//! PDF preview: a continuously scrolling document, a thumbnail rail, and a
//! page/zoom toolbar — the shape every browser and OS viewer has settled on.
//!
//! **Why a render worker.** hayro's `RenderCache<'a>` borrows the document and
//! is `Rc`-based, so it can neither be shared between threads nor stored
//! beside the `Arc<PdfDocument>` every view holds. Building a fresh one per
//! page throws away decoded fonts and images: measured on a 651-page
//! text-heavy book, 50 ms a page with a fresh cache against 27.7 ms sharing
//! one. So each open document gets a [`PdfRenderer`] — a couple of threads
//! that each own the document and one warm cache for as long as the pane is
//! open, fed by a priority queue and answering over a channel.
//!
//! **Why a list, not a page.** Rendering is fast enough only if it happens
//! before the reader arrives. A virtualized `uniform_list` over every page
//! makes "what is about to be visible" a fact the layout already knows, so
//! [`PageStore::request_window`] can queue exactly that and nothing else.
//! Scrolling within a page then costs nothing at all.
//!
//! The page is painted on an opaque white ground, so every pixel hayro hands
//! back has alpha 255 and premultiplied equals straight. The only conversion
//! before `RenderImage::new` is the RGBA→BGRA swap gpui expects.
