//! playback crate plus bundled sound assets just to play two short blips, this
//! hands a stock macOS system sound to `afplay`. That keeps the crate's
//! dependency surface unchanged and means there are no binary assets to ship or
//! license.
//!
//! Non-macOS targets compile to a no-op — TREX is macOS-only today, and a
//! missing cue must never be a build error.

//! Playback is fire-and-forget: [`play`] returns immediately and must never
//! block the caller, because it runs on the GPUI main thread at the moment a
//! recording starts.
