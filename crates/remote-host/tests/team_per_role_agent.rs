//! |----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
//! | a role's own agent reaches the launcher      | a launcher that records what it was asked  |
//! | a role naming none falls back to the run's   | the same recording                         |
//! | the board reports which agent worked a role  | reading it back through `TeamStatusV2`     |
//! | a role's model reaches the LAUNCHER          | the same recording — and no `set_model` at all |
//! | a v18 run still reads back                   | created through the v18 verb, read through v2 |
//!
//! The model assertion is about *where* the model is applied, not merely that
//! it is. Applying it as a switch after launch is the obvious shape and it is
//! wrong: Claude and Codex take `--model` on the command line and refuse to
//! change it at runtime, so on a headless host that switch bails for exactly
//! the two agents this feature exists to combine. No stub can catch that by
//! being unswitchable — `StubConnection::set_model` succeeds — so the gate is
//! that the backend is never asked to switch at all.
