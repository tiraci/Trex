//! The project-listing seam: enumerating the desktop's projects so a client can
//! start a session in one without typing its path.
//!
//! Like [`SessionLauncher`](crate::SessionLauncher), the data lives in the GPUI
//! app layer (the recent-projects list the sidebar renders), not in the
//! spawn-free registry — so the dispatcher talks to this trait and the app
//! supplies the implementation. The paired complement to `create`: this tells the
//! phone *where* it may start a session; the launcher then starts it there.
