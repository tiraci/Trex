//! The per-connection RPC dispatcher — transport-agnostic.
//!
//! It owns one connection's auth state, decodes each `Request` frame, and routes
//! it to the [`SessionRegistry`]. It depends only on the `remote-proto`
//! [`Transport`] seam, so the iroh endpoint is one driver and the in-memory
//! loopback drives tests with no network.
//!
//! The connection loop lives in [`serve`]: it multiplexes incoming client
//! requests against the live events of any active `Subscribe`, so a live event is
//! pushed the moment it is produced. The forwarding invariants live in [`stream`];
//! the handshake in [`handshake`]; the authenticated session RPCs in [`handlers`].
//!
//! **Authorization is re-checked on every session RPC *and* every live frame**,
//! not just at connect: a device revoked mid-connection (Phase 7) must stop being
//! served even though its transport is still open.
