//! The worktree-management seam: creating, listing, and removing a project's
//! git worktrees, expressed without depending on the app that does it.
//!
//! The same split as [`SessionLauncher`](crate::SessionLauncher): the real work
//! needs the app's data directory, its project registry, and its workspace
//! storage — none of which this crate holds — so the dispatcher talks to this
//! trait and the app supplies the implementation.
//!
//! **The worktree target path is derived by the implementation, never accepted
//! from a client.** A caller names a project by the root path it was already
//! handed (a `ListProjects` row) and a slug; the implementation resolves the
//! project against its own records — refusing a path it does not know — and
//! composes the worktree directory itself, exactly as the desktop's own
//! New-Worktree flow does. Removal is by the row id a listing carried, so no
//! RPC on this surface ever turns a client-supplied string into a filesystem
//! path.
