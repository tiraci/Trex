//! The read-only forge RPCs: issues, pull requests, and CI checks for the
//! repository a session lives in.
//!
//! **No credential crosses this boundary.** Every query shells out to the
//! `gh`/`glab` CLI already signed in on the desktop, so the phone holds no
//! token, runs no OAuth flow, and stores nothing. That is not a convenience —
//! it is the reason this surface can exist at all without a credential-handling
//! story on a device that is easier to lose than a laptop.
//!
//! The repository is resolved from the session's own `cwd`, the same way the git
//! RPCs do it, so forge access inherits the device's existing session ACL: a
//! session-scoped device cannot enumerate another project's issues.
//!
//! **Empty is a normal answer here, and this module must keep it that way.** The
//! underlying transport degrades to empty for every "can't tell" case — CLI
//! absent, CLI signed out, repo not forge-hosted, network down — and the
//! temptation is to translate some of those into errors so the client can say
//! something more specific. It cannot: the host genuinely does not know which
//! case it hit, and inventing a reason would put a wrong explanation in front of
//! the user. So the contract is forwarded unchanged and the client renders
//! "nothing here".
