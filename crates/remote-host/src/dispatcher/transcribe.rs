//! The voice-transcription handler — decode one recorded clip to text.
//!
//! Unlike the schedule and session RPCs this names no session and changes no
//! state: it is a composer utility, so it gates on the authenticated connection
//! alone (checked in [`serve`](super::serve) before this is reached), not on
//! device tier or `is_allowed_for`. Any paired device may dictate, exactly as
//! any of them may type.
//!
//! Base64 decoding and the size guard live here (wire concerns); the audio
//! parsing, resample, and ONNX decode live behind the
//! [`AudioTranscriber`](crate::transcribe::AudioTranscriber) seam, in the app.
