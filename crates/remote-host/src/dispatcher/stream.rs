//! Live event forwarding for `Subscribe`.
//!
//! A subscription turns a session's registry broadcast into a `'static` stream of
//! tagged [`LiveFrame`]s that the serve loop merges (`SelectAll`) and pushes to the
//! client as [`Response::Event`] frames. Two invariants ride here:
//!
//! - **Per-frame authorization recheck.** Revocation and per-device scope must bite
//!   the live stream too, not only request RPCs — so a device revoked mid-stream
//!   stops receiving events even though its broadcast receiver is still open.
//! - **Backlog dedup cursor.** Subscribing snapshots the backlog *after* taking the
//!   broadcast receiver, so an event landing in that gap is caught by the live
//!   stream; a per-session cursor then drops any live `seq` already covered by the
//!   backlog batch, so the client never sees a `seq` twice.
