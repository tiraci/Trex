//! The schedule RPC handlers — create, list, delete, toggle, and read run
//! history for the desktop's scheduled agent runs.
//!
//! Unlike the session RPCs these name no session, so they scope on device *tier*
//! rather than `is_allowed_for`: reads want full scope
//! ([`AuthStore::may_read_schedules`](crate::auth::AuthStore::may_read_schedules)),
//! writes want full-and-not-read-only
//! ([`may_manage_schedules`](crate::auth::AuthStore::may_manage_schedules)) —
//! because a schedule is a deferred session spawn and a narrowed device could
//! otherwise plant one that runs outside its own confinement.
//!
//! The store itself is gpui-free and process-spawn-free (SQLite rows only), so
//! these handlers call it directly, without the view-layer seam `launcher` and
//! `rewinder` need. Wire ↔ store conversion lives here, keeping `remote-proto`
//! free of any `trex-agents` dependency.
