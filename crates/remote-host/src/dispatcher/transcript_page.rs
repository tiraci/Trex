//! The paginated folded-transcript fetch (`FetchTranscriptPage`, v16).
//!
//! The v13 `FetchTranscript` returns the whole snapshot in one frame, which
//! works until a long session's fold outgrows the transport's 16 MB frame cap —
//! at which point the client loses the *entire* history, not the part that
//! overflowed. This handler serves the same snapshot in entry-indexed pages,
//! each bounded well under the cap, so any transcript is fetchable. The legacy
//! verb stays untouched (postcard payloads may never be reshaped) and v15
//! phones keep using it.
