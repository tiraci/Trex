//! The coordination-state RPC handlers — the shared blackboard.
//!
//! Reads and writes are gated on the caller's *tier*, not on any session: the
//! board is host-wide by construction, because one narrowed to a single session
//! would coordinate nothing. See
//! [`may_read_state`](crate::auth::AuthStore::may_read_state) for why that is
//! defensible — the board holds only what agents deliberately put on it.
//!
//! A refused conditional write is **not** an `Error`: it comes back as the
//! entry the caller lost to, so a losing writer can merge and retry without a
//! second round trip. The CLI turns that into its own exit code.
