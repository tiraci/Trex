//! The manual-fire seam behind [`Request::RunScheduleNow`], plus the shared
//! store-row → wire conversion every schedule surface uses.
//!
//! Like [`SessionLauncher`](crate::SessionLauncher), the real work lives above
//! this crate — the ticker that owns the in-flight guard and the durable claim
//! is host-side, because only the process holding the ticker lock may fire.
//! The dispatcher checks *authorization*; the runner reports whether the fire
//! could happen and how it went.
