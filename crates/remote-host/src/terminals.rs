//! The terminal seam: what the dispatcher needs from the desktop's PTY layer,
//! expressed without depending on it.
//!
//! `remote-host` cannot reach the relay directly — the relay client lives in the
//! app, speaks a Unix-socket protocol of its own, and pulling it in here would
//! make this crate untestable without a running daemon. So the dispatcher talks
//! to this trait and the app supplies the implementation, exactly as
//! [`DeviceStore`](crate::auth::DeviceStore) does for device persistence.
//!
//! The shape is deliberately narrow. Terminals are the highest-risk surface on
//! this protocol — bytes into a live shell is arbitrary code execution on the
//! developer's machine — so this exposes listing, attaching, writing, and
//! resizing, and nothing else. There is no path argument anywhere, and no way to
//! spawn or kill a terminal remotely: a phone can drive terminals the desktop
//! user already opened, not create new ones.
