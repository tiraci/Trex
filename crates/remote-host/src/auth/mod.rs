//! Two-key pairing/auth + a two-level ACL.
//!
//! - **Pairing** ([`pairing`]) proves a client scanned this host's QR: `Register`
//!   carries an `HMAC-SHA256(handshake_secret, app_pubkey || timestamp)` proof,
//!   checked inside a ±60s window. The secret never crosses the wire.
//! - **Identity** is the client's app-signing Ed25519 key (decoupled from the
//!   iroh transport key), which the host authorizes and can revoke.
//! - **Reconnect** ([`reconnect`]) is a `session_token` fast path, or an Ed25519
//!   challenge/nonce.
//! - **ACL** ([`acl`]): a global authorized set + a per-device scope. A one-time
//!   ticket bound to a session restricts that device to it; a static ticket
//!   grants full access (the confirmed default).
//!
//! Every check is a method on [`AuthStore`] so the dispatcher can re-run
//! authorization on **every** RPC — revocation must bite even a connection that
//! is already open.
