//! The ACL as one table: every predicate against every caller class.
//!
//! The sibling [`tests`](super::tests) module proves the *pairing* machinery —
//! that a proof registers, that revocation bites, that a one-time code is spent.
//! This one proves the **authorization** half, and it exists because that half
//! had no direct coverage at all: eleven of the seventeen predicates were
//! reachable only through a dispatcher RPC, and the two local classes — the
//! operator and the session-confined agent — were not exercised anywhere.
//!
//! That gap mattered most where the design leans hardest. Agent CLI access is on
//! by default and session-scoped, so [`LocalScope::Session`] is the *sole*
//! containment boundary around an agent that can already run arbitrary code in
//! its own workspace. A silent widening of any full-host predicate would hand
//! that agent the host, and nothing here would have noticed.
//!
//! Written as a whole-row comparison rather than a heap of individual asserts:
//! a mismatch prints the expected and actual rows side by side, so a diff reads
//! as "this class gained `manage_worktrees`" instead of as one anonymous
//! `assert!` line number.
