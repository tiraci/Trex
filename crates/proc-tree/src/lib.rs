//! Walk the descendants of a process, by pid.
//!
//! A terminal's PTY child is a *shell*; whatever the user typed into it —
//! `codex`, `gemini`, a build — runs as that shell's descendant. Asking the
//! kernel who those descendants are is the only way to know a program is
//! running in a terminal that does not depend on the program announcing
//! itself. Unlike a window title or a status sideband, a live pid is a fact:
//! it exists while the program runs, whether or not the program is producing
//! output, and it is gone the moment the program exits.
//!
//! Sibling of [`trex-proc-cwd`](../../proc-cwd), and its own crate for the
//! same reason: dependency-light kernel introspection that the app and the
//! relay both reach for, sharing nothing else.
//!
//! macOS: `proc_listpids(PROC_PPID_ONLY)` for children, `proc_name` for the
//! executable name, `sysctl(KERN_PROCARGS2)` for the argument vector.
//!
//! Linux: one pass over `/proc/<pid>/stat` builds the parent→children map;
//! `/proc/<pid>/comm` and `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` supply name and arguments.
//!
//! Windows: a `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` process walk supplies names. Reading
//! another process's command line there needs `NtQueryInformationProcess`
//! against a foreign address space, so [`cmdline_of_pid`] reports `None` and
//! callers fall back to matching the executable name.
