//! SIGTERM → grace window → SIGKILL dance for `PortablePtyBackend::close`.
//!
//! Extracted from `portable_pty_backend.rs` for two reasons:
//! 1. The grace logic is conceptually independent of the backend; the
//!    backend just plumbs the right `term_fn` / `kill_fn` closures in.
//! 2. The unit-test surface is wide (5 mock-watcher scenarios) and keeping
//!    the backend module under the 500 LOC warn threshold (xtask
//!    file-size-lint) matters more than module-locality.
//!
//! Public-to-the-crate surface:
//! - `TermResult` — outcome of the SIGTERM step.
//! - `term_step(pid)` — sends SIGTERM to the negative pid (process group)
//!   on Unix; returns `Skipped` on non-Unix or when `pid` is `None`.
//! - `WatcherHandle` trait + `JoinHandleWatcher` production newtype.
//! - `close_with_grace(...)` — the dance itself.
