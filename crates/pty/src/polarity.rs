//! Which way round the host window's background reads — and how that gets
//! told to the programs running inside the terminal.
//!
//! A child program asks this question twice, by two unrelated mechanisms,
//! and picks its own colors from the answer:
//!
//! - `COLORFGBG`, read from the environment once at startup (vim's
//!   `background` detection, base16-shell, and a long tail of scripts).
//! - OSC 11 (`ESC ] 11 ; ? BEL`), queried over the TTY at runtime by fzf,
//!   delta, bat, and modern agent CLIs including Claude Code.
//!
//! Answer "dark" to either one while the window is painted white and the
//! program cooperatively picks a palette tuned for near-black, then emits it
//! as 24-bit truecolor. Those sequences carry explicit r/g/b, so they flow
//! straight through the named- and indexed-color mapping the renderer
//! applies — nothing downstream can correct them. The result is pastel text
//! on white that no theme work in the app can reach. The only fix is to stop
//! giving the wrong answer.
//!
//! This is process-wide rather than per-session on purpose: it describes the
//! window every terminal is painted into, not any one terminal. A per-session
//! value would have to be set identically on every session and would drift
//! the first time a spawn path forgot it.
//!
//! Note what this cannot do. A program reads the answer when it starts and
//! keeps the palette it chose. Switching theme repaints TREX's own chrome
//! immediately, but a shell that is already running has no reason to ask
//! again — its existing output keeps the colors it picked. New programs, and
//! anything that re-queries, follow at once.
//!
//! # Windows delivers only one of the two answers
//!
//! Measured on Windows 10 through ConPTY, in this order:
//!
//! - The child's OSC 11 query *does* reach our emulator (alacritty raises
//!   `ColorRequest` for slot 257), and the reply is written back to the
//!   master with no error.
//! - The child never receives it.
//! - A DSR cursor-position report — same emulator, same `PtyReply` event,
//!   same `write` call — *does* arrive, as `ESC [ 5;1 R`.
//!
//! So the write-back path is sound and this is not something to go looking
//! for in our code: ConPTY translates master-side bytes into console input
//! records, and it passes CSI replies through while dropping OSC ones. That
//! leaves `COLORFGBG` as the only channel that actually carries the polarity
//! on Windows, which is the main reason it is set here rather than left to
//! the OSC path alone. On a real tty the reply is just input bytes and both
//! channels work.
//!
//! Keep answering OSC 11 regardless. It is correct, it is what every non-
//! Windows target uses, and a future ConPTY may well deliver it.
