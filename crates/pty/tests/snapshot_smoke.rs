//! Verifies the alacritty wiring: bytes from the PTY flow through the ANSI

//! matrix whose rendered text contains the marker. This catches three

//!   1. State machine never advanced (cells all empty).
//!   2. `fill_snapshot` reads the wrong dimensions (returns a partial grid).
//!   3. Resize path corrupts the grid (we resize mid-test).
