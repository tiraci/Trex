//! Killing a child *and everything it started*, on Windows.
//!
//! On unix every process the app spawns for an agent or a terminal is put in its
//! own process group, so one `kill(-pgid, …)` reaches the child, the shell it
//! ran, and whatever that shell ran. Windows has no process groups in that
//! sense: `TerminateProcess` ends exactly one process, and the tree it started
//! keeps running with no parent to account for it. An agent CLI's `bash` tool
//! children, a terminal's compiler, a dev server holding a port — all of them
//! outlive the thing the user actually stopped.
//!
//! A Job Object is the mechanism that does have tree semantics. A child assigned
//! to one is joined by everything it spawns afterwards, and terminating the job
//! terminates the whole set. Two properties make it worth the ceremony:
//!
//! - `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` means the tree dies when the last
//!   handle to the job closes — including the implicit close when *this* process
//!   dies. So an app crash reaps its agents rather than stranding them, which is
//!   a guarantee the unix side does not actually have.
//! - Assignment is inherited, so a grandchild is covered without being tracked.
//!
//! The gap this does not close: a process spawned by the child in the window
//! between `CreateProcess` returning and `AssignProcessToJobObject` running is
//! not in the job. Closing it needs `CREATE_SUSPENDED` and a resume, which
//! `std::process::Command` gives no way to express. The race is small — the
//! child has to fork before its first instruction is scheduled — and the
//! consequence is one escaped process rather than a broken kill, so this starts
//! here and escalates to a raw `CreateProcessW` spawn seam only if an orphan is
//! ever actually observed.
