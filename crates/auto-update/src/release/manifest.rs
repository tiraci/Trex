//! The release manifest: what versions exist and what their artifacts hash to.
//!
//! The manifest is the *only* thing signed. Everything downstream — which
//! archive to fetch, what it must hash to, how big it may be — is read out of
//! it, which is why [`super::verify`] checks the signature over the raw bytes
//! before this module is allowed to parse them.
//!
//! Asset URLs are deliberately **not** in the manifest. They are derived from
//! a fixed base, the signed version, and the signed file name, so a manifest
//! cannot point the downloader at a host of its choosing even if the signing
//! key is one day misused. The host allow-list downstream stays meaningful.
