//! The signed-release trust chain, shared by every updater in the workspace.
//!
//! Two very different programs update themselves from the same GitHub Release:
//! `TREX update` replaces two CLI binaries, and the desktop app replaces its
//! whole install directory at quit. What they must *not* have is two answers to
//! "is this release genuine" — so the manifest, its signature, the download
//! host allow-list, and the move-aside/move-in swap live here, once.
//!
//! The trust chain, in the order it must run and for the reason it must run in
//! that order:
//!
//! ```text
//! minisign signature over manifest.json   ← the only independent trust root
//!   └─ manifest parsed (never before)
//!        └─ version strictly greater than the running one
//!             └─ artifact fetched, sha256 checked against the signed manifest
//!                  └─ extracted, platform gate, all-or-nothing swap
//! ```
//!
//! The first step is what makes the rest worth anything. A sha256 taken from a
//! manifest published beside the artifact it describes proves only that the
//! download matches what the publisher said; a compromised publish token
//! rewrites both. The signature is checked against a key compiled into the
//! binary, which that token cannot reach.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* here: how a given program's payload is unpacked
//! and which files it owns. The CLI extracts two names out of a `.tar.gz`; the
//! desktop app unpacks a whole directory out of a `.zip`. Those are the parts
//! that legitimately differ, and each lives with its own consumer.
