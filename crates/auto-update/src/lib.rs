//! In-app auto-update for the desktop bundle.
//!
//! The lifecycle, deliberately split in two:
//!
//! 1. **Background** (this crate, via [`spawn_check`]): poll the release
//!    feed, download the DMG, mount it, copy the app to a hidden staging dir
//!    next to the installed bundle, and verify it against the boot-time
//!    signature pin. Ends at [`UpdateStatus::Ready`] — a verified bundle
//!    *staged on disk*, installed bundle untouched.
//! 2. **Quit** (the app's shutdown path): re-verify the staged bundle and
//!    atomically swap it in. Never while running — subprocesses are resolved
//!    from the bundle path at spawn time (relay daemon, hook CLI, screen
//!    gate), and swapping under a live process would hand an old-version app
//!    new-version helpers.
//!
//! Restart is always the user's move. An ignored update simply applies on
//! the next natural quit.

//! ## Platform split
//!
//! The state machine, the release feed, and version comparison are plain data
//! work and compile everywhere. Everything that touches the *shape of an
//! install* is per-platform, because the two shapes have nothing in common: a
//! macOS install is one `.app` bundle delivered as a DMG and pinned to a
//! Developer ID signature; a Windows install is a directory of loose files
//! delivered as a zip and anchored to the signed release manifest. See
//! [`windows`] for the full comparison and why the trust roots differ.
//!
//! What both sides share — the manifest, its minisign signature, the download
//! host allow-list, the all-or-nothing swap — lives in [`release`], once, and
//! is shared with the CLI's `TREX update` rather than reimplemented per
//! consumer.
//!
//! The two platform modules present the same three entry points, so the host
//! app drives one code path: `eligibility` (is this install updatable),
//! `pipeline::run` (stage a verified payload), and `staging::apply_pending`
//! (swap it in at quit).
