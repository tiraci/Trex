//! Where a verified Windows payload waits for the quit-time swap, and what
//! happens to it at boot, at quit, and after a crash.
//!
//! # Why the swap waits for quit
//!
//! The same reason macOS waits: several things this app spawns are resolved
//! from the install path *at spawn time* — the relay daemon, the `agent-status`
//! hook CLI embedded into live agent sessions, the screen-control gate.
//! Replacing files under a running process would leave an old-version app
//! spawning new-version helpers, a skew with no error path because each side is
//! individually valid.
//!
//! Windows adds a second, blunter reason: it refuses to overwrite a mapped
//! image at all. `TREX.exe` and every DLL beside it are mapped for as long as
//! the process lives, and the "move aside, then move in" swap in
//! [`crate::release::swap`] is what makes the replacement possible even then.
//!
//! # What is trusted, and when
//!
//! The trust root is the minisign signature over the release manifest, checked
//! against a key compiled into this binary at the moment of staging. It is
//! **not** re-checked at quit, and the reason is worth stating plainly rather
//! than implying a guarantee that is not there: an attacker who could rewrite
//! the staged payload between staging and quit could equally well rewrite
//! `TREX.exe` in the install directory directly, since a per-user install
//! under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs` is writable by exactly one account. There is
//! no privilege boundary for a re-verification to defend. (macOS pins a
//! codesign identity because `/Applications` is admin-group-writable, which is
//! a genuinely different threat model, not a stricter version of this one.)
//!
//! What *is* re-checked at quit is integrity: every staged file is re-hashed
//! against the digests recorded when it was written. That catches the failure
//! that actually happens — a half-swept staging directory, a disk that filled
//! during extraction, an antivirus quarantine that removed one DLL — and it
//! catches it before anything in the install directory has been touched.
