//! One background check, start to finish: ask the release feed, prove what
//! comes back, and leave a verified payload staged beside the install.
//!
//! The run ends at [`UpdateStatus::Ready`] — files on disk, install directory
//! untouched. Nothing here replaces anything; that is
//! [`super::staging::apply_pending`]'s job at quit, for the reasons in that
//! module's header.
//!
//! Cancellation is cooperative and checked between steps rather than inside
//! them. The steps are a few seconds each at worst, and a download that has
//! already started is cheaper to finish and discard than to tear down mid-write.
