//! Merge with auto-stash recovery.
//!
//! The single entry point — [`Repository::merge_branch`] — runs
//! `git merge --no-edit <branch>`, honoring the user's `merge.ff` config (no
//! `--no-ff`). When the working tree is dirty going in, it stashes first and
//! arranges that the resulting [`MergeOutcome`] surfaces the stash ref on
//! BOTH the clean-merge and conflict paths so the caller can always restore
//! the pre-merge state.
//!
//! The caller is the desktop's `Merge into <default>` row action
//! (`apps/desktop/src/shell/workspace/merge_ops.rs`), which merges a
//! worktree's branch into the project's default branch by opening a
//! `Repository` at the PROJECT ROOT — `merge_branch` merges the named branch
//! into the repository it is called on, so opening the worktree instead would
//! merge main into the feature branch. The pre-flight that guards it lives in
//! `trex-worktree-ops::merge`.
//!
//! Error-recovery contract (locked 2026-05-17, Q1):
//! When the merge fails with a NonZero exit (e.g. unknown branch) AFTER an
//! auto-stash was pushed, we pop the stash before returning `Err`. Atomic:
//! "merge failed = back to where I was." If the pop itself fails (rare), we
//! `tracing::warn!` and return the merge error chained with a note that the
//! stash ref is dangling.
