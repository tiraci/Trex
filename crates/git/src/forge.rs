//! Which forge backs a repo, and the read-only queries routed to it.
//!
//! The desktop's `ForgeProvider` layer (in the `app` crate) covers the full
//! surface including the mutating calls. This module holds only the read-only
//! subset — plus, importantly, the **host detection** — so a caller that cannot
//! depend on the desktop can still ask a repo about its issues, pull requests
//! and CI checks.
//!
//! The detection lives here rather than being reimplemented per caller because
//! its ordering is load-bearing and easy to get subtly wrong: see [`detect`].
//! One implementation, two callers.
//!
//! Every query keeps the transport's graceful-degradation contract: a missing
//! CLI, an unauthenticated CLI, a repo hosted nowhere relevant, or a network
//! failure all resolve to empty/`None` rather than an error. Callers show a
//! "nothing here" state, never a failure the user cannot act on.
