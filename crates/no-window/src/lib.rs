//! `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` for every child the app spawns.
//!
//! # The failure this exists to stop
//!
//! The packaged Windows build is a GUI-subsystem process — it has no console.
//! When a process without a console spawns a console-subsystem child (`git`,
//! `rg`, the `node` behind every npm-installed agent CLI, an LSP server),
//! Windows conjures a brand-new console window for that child. Its stdio is
//! piped, so the window is empty — the user just sees bare terminal windows
//! appear: one per LSP server, one per restored agent session, and a fresh
//! flash every 500 ms courtesy of the git status poller.
//!
//! Nothing in the app ever wants that window. Every child either talks over
//! pipes or over a ConPTY (which renders into TREX itself), so the console
//! Windows offers to create has nothing to show — `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` declines
//! it. On every other platform there is no such window and this is a no-op,
//! which is why call sites apply it unconditionally instead of behind a `cfg`.
//!
//! # Why a crate
//!
//! The same reason as `owner-only` and `job-object`: the spawn sites live in
//! crates that share no other dependency (`git`, `agents`, `editor`,
//! `dictation`, the desktop app…), and a copy-pasted flag constant is exactly
//! the kind of thing the next spawn site forgets. One trait, imported where a
//! `Command` is built, keeps the fix greppable and the omission visible.
//!
//! Note for future spawn sites: `creation_flags` *replaces* previously set
//! flags rather than OR-ing into them, so a site that needs another flag
//! (e.g. `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`) must pass the union itself instead of
//! stacking a manual `creation_flags` call on top of `no_window()`.

/// `dwCreationFlags` bit: run the child without a console at all.
///
/// Chosen over `DETACHED_PROCESS` deliberately — `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` still
/// gives the child a (hidden) console, so children that probe their console
/// handles or take `CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT` keep working; detaching outright
/// breaks console-API users in ways that only surface at runtime.
