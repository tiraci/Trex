//! Owner-only access control for the Windows named pipe.
//!
//! A unix-domain socket inherits the protection of the directory holding it, so
//! the relay's socket is unreachable to other accounts without anything being
//! spelled out. `\\.\pipe\` has no such containment: it is one flat namespace
//! shared by every session on the machine, and a pipe created with the default
//! security descriptor is reachable by principals that have no business
//! carrying this daemon's traffic — which is every keystroke typed into every
//! terminal and every byte those terminals print back.
//!
//! So the descriptor is stated explicitly, and every path through this module
//! either produces one or fails. There is deliberately no fallback that creates
//! the pipe without it: a relay that refuses to start is a visible problem,
//! while a relay listening on an open pipe is an invisible one.
//!
//! The descriptor itself comes from `trex-owner-only`, which the token and
//! key files use too — the pipe and those files are protected by one definition
//! of "only this account", not three that can drift apart.
