//! Diff review notes — a reviewer's per-line comment on a diff.
//!
//! Lives in `trex-core` so the diff view (compose / render) and storage
//! (`DiffReviewNoteRepo` row mapping) share one source of truth. Notes are
//! anchored to a stable `(repo, diff_ref, path, side, line)` coordinate
//! rather than a render-row index, so they re-attach to the right line when
//! the diff reopens — independent of folds, scroll, or split mode.
