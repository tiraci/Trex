//! Lives in `trex-core` so the UI (badge, sidebar dot) and storage
//! (`AgentSessionRepo` row mapping in Phase 4) share one source of truth
//! without pulling `trex-agents` (which owns the runtime traits + tokio).
//!
//! `AgentSessionId` is a transient handle minted by the runtime per
//! launch; the persisted `AgentSession::id` (`String` UUID) below is the
//! SQLite primary key. They are deliberately distinct types so a
//! transient runtime handle cannot be mistaken for a persisted row id at
//! compile time.
