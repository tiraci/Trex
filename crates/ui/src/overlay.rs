//! Shared chrome for floating surfaces (popovers, pickers, dialogs, menus,
//! toasts).
//!
//! The recipe — overlay background, a 1px active-border outline, card-radius
//! corners — was hand-rolled identically across ~13 surfaces. Centralizing it
//! here means the surface contract lives in one place, and the top
//! inner-highlight (a 1px edge catching light that reads as elevation without a
//! shadow) is a one-line addition everywhere instead of a per-file change.
//!
//! Applied in-chain via [`FloatingSurface::floating_chrome`] so it drops in
//! wherever a surface already hand-rolled `bg_overlay` + `border_active` +
//! `r_card`, replacing those calls with one and leaving the surface's own
//! padding, sizing, layout, and content children untouched.
