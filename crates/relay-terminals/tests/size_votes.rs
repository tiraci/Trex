//! Two attachments to one terminal, against a real relay daemon booted
//! in-process.
//!
//! The property under test belongs to the daemon: it runs a PTY at the smallest
//! grid any attachment asks for, so every attachment holds a standing vote and a
//! resize is a change to *one* of them. That contract cannot be checked against a
//! stand-in — a fake would simply agree with whatever this crate did — so these
//! drive the daemon itself.
//!
//! What makes this worth a real daemon: one [`RelayTerminals`] is shared by every
//! paired device, so two phones watching one terminal are two attachments through
//! one of these. If the attachment were resolved from the PTY here rather than
//! carried by the caller, the second device to attach would own every later
//! resize and the first device's vote would never be recorded at all.
