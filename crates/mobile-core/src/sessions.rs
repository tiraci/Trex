//! Session-list subscription over the FFI: the pump that forwards pushed
//! session-list snapshots to the app's [`SessionsSink`], the sink registration, and
//! the per-connection (re)subscribe.
//!
//! The core stays out of session-list *policy* — the host builds the per-device
//! list; the core forwards each pushed snapshot verbatim, so the app replaces its
//! list wholesale rather than folding deltas. This is the push counterpart to the
//! pull [`list_sessions`](MobileClient::list_sessions) RPC, which stays as a manual
//! refresh affordance.
