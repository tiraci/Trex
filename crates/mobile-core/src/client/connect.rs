//! Wiring the pure-Rust [`maintain_connection`] driver into the FFI client: it
//! ties the injected [`Connector`], the reconnect policy, and the demux pump into
//! one self-healing loop. The driver owns the connection lifecycle — pairing on
//! the first dial, reconnecting on every drop — and reports each transition here
//! so the UI reflects it and the very first outcome flows back to `connect_with`.
