//! Live subscription: fold a session's `HostEvent` stream and push the folded
//! transcript to the foreign [`ThreadSink`]. The demux pump feeds one
//! connection-wide event stream; [`run_dispatcher`] routes each frame to the
//! matching registered session and heals seq gaps via `events_since`.
//!
//! **Pushes are batched, not per-event.** A snapshot costs one serialization of
//! the whole transcript, so pushing per streaming text delta would re-serialize
//! the entire thread per token. The dispatcher instead drains every frame already
//! queued, folds them all, and pushes once — so a burst coalesces into a single
//! push while a quiet stream still pushes immediately. That needs no timer and
//! adds no latency: batching only happens when frames are genuinely waiting.
//!
//! Known limitations (deferred robustness, acceptable for this slice):
//! - **Decode-`Err` wedge:** if a frame's `ThreadEvent` fails to decode (only
//!   reachable under phone/desktop version skew — both build from one workspace
//!   today), the fold cursor can't advance past it, so the session's stream
//!   silently stalls and re-fetches the same frame. A robust fix needs the fold
//!   to skip-advance + surface an unrecoverable signal.
//! - **Subscribe race:** a live frame arriving between the backlog RPC returning
//!   and the `Sub` being registered is dropped; the seq-gap logic recovers all
//!   but a literal end-of-turn last event. A seed-buffer would close the window.
