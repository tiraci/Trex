//! `WorktreeSettingsRepo` — typed CRUD over the V006 `worktree_settings`
//! table (one optional SCM scratch row per workspace).
//!
//! All payload columns are nullable; `get` returns `None` when no row
//! exists at all (callers MUST treat that as `WorktreeSettings::default()`).
//! `upsert` writes every field unconditionally — callers who want to
//! merge against existing state should `get` first.
