# TREX — Design Guidelines (v1)

This document is the source of truth for visual identity, palette, density, typography,
and composition patterns. It drives `crates/settings/src/theme.rs`, `density.rs`, and
`typography.rs`; keep both in sync when changing any token.

When the doc is silent: read the closest sibling code in `apps/desktop/src/shell/` and
follow its lead. If the question is structural (which primitive, when), see the
Primitive-Picking Fork. If the question is "is there a token for X", check the tables
below first — every shipped surface routes through them.

## Brand

**Name**: TREX.
**One-line**: Rust-native, multi-agent development cockpit for macOS.
**Tone**: Quiet, technical, terminal-first. Not playful. Not "AI".

`Oxi` = oxidation (Rust). `Mux` = multiplexer (the cockpit metaphor: many agents,
many panes, one operator).

## Mode

Two palettes, chosen in Settings → Appearance and persisted in `appearance.toml`:
**Charcoal** (dark, the default and the one every token below is written against) and
**Paper** (light). They fill the same `Theme` struct, so no render path branches on
which is in force — a view reads `theme.bg_panel` and gets the right answer.

Three groups of token do not survive a straight inversion, and they are where a light
theme usually goes wrong. Read `crates/settings/src/theme.rs`'s module docs before
touching any of them:

- **Alpha overlays** (`hover_overlay`, `border_inactive`, `border_input`,
  `edge_highlight`) are white-at-alpha on charcoal so one token composites to the same
  perceived step over every surface tier. White over paper is invisible — they flip to
  black, at a *lower* alpha, because a dark veil over white reads stronger than a light
  veil over black at equal opacity.
- **Elevation** runs opposite. On charcoal a floating card is lighter than its ground.
  On paper the canvas is already the lightest thing on screen, so a card returns to the
  canvas value and reads as raised through its border and shadow instead.
- **The surface ladder** is not mirrored. Paper keeps the content canvas white — that is
  what a page of code should be — and puts the chrome a step *below* it. So `bg_rail` is
  lighter than `bg_panel` on charcoal and darker than it on paper; both mean "this slab
  is distinct from the canvas beside it".

`theme.is_light()` is the branch for the rare place that genuinely needs one; today that
is the terminal's sixteen named ANSI colors, which cannot be shared across polarities.

## Palette — Monochrome Charcoal

The base is near-black with graphite panels. Status hues are the only saturated color
in the UI. This keeps the eye on the diff, terminal, and agent output — not chrome.

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `bg_base` | `#0E0F11` | Window background, dock empty area |
| `bg_panel` | `#15171A` | Sidebar, status bar, panel backgrounds |
| `bg_panel_alt` | `#1B1E22` | Selected row, nested panel (persistent fills — transient hover moved to `hover_overlay`) |
| `bg_overlay` | `#22262B` | Tooltip, popover, command palette, context menu; ALSO the raised/active fill on the lifted rail (`bg_panel_alt` sits below `bg_rail` and would read pressed-in there) |
| `bg_rail` | `#1D2024` | Left-rail surface — deliberately lighter than `bg_panel` so the rail reads as a raised slab beside the near-black content canvas. Rail-scoped: do NOT re-level `bg_panel`, the global panel < panel_alt < overlay ladder depends on it |
| `fg_base` | `#E6E8EB` | Body text |
| `fg_muted` | `#9AA0A6` | Labels, secondary text, inactive tabs |
| `fg_subtle` | `#6B7177` | Disabled, placeholder, gutter numbers, chevrons |
| `border_inactive` | white @ 8% alpha | Pane dividers, card edges — composites over any layer as a hairline catching light, not a flat grey line |
| `border_active` | `#3A4047` | Focused pane border, popover outline (solid — focus must stay unambiguous against the faint dividers) |
| `edge_highlight` | white @ 6% alpha | 1px top inner-highlight on floating surfaces — reads as elevation without a shadow |
| `hover_overlay` | white @ 6% alpha | Transient hover fill on rows/cards/menu items — composites to a uniform brightness step over any surface tier (a flat hex hover read inverted on overlay cards). Hover ONLY; selected/persistent fills stay `bg_panel_alt` |
| `border_input` | white @ 15% alpha | Resting border on text inputs (routed through the gpui-component `colors.input` slot) — stronger than the hairline dividers so the type-here affordance reads; focused state keeps its existing solid treatment |
| `selection` | `#2D3A4D` | Text selection background; also "currently-open" row tint |
| `focus_ring` | `#4A6E9C` | Keyboard focus outline |
| `match_bg_current` | `#D9A441` | Cycled "you-are-here" search match (Cmd+F) |
| `match_bg_other` | `#5A5358` | Non-current search matches |
| `match_fg` | `#0E0F11` | Foreground over `match_bg_current` (high contrast) |

### Status palette (single accent layer)

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `status_ok` | `#6FA86A` | Clean working tree, agent done, test pass |
| `status_warn` | `#D9A441` | Dirty tree, approval pending, lint warn |
| `status_error` | `#D26464` | Conflict, panic, test fail; row-level destructive verb |
| `status_info` | `#5B97C9` | Running, fetching, building |
| `status_muted` | `#6B7177` | Idle, paused, untracked |

### SCM-specific palette

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `status_added` | `#64D26B` | SCM diff +N count, "added" line tint |
| `status_removed` | `#D26464` | SCM diff −N count (aliases `status_error`) |
| `status_warning` | `#D2A864` | Conflict / in-progress operation banner |
| `graph_lane_colors[0..5]` | `#FFB000` `#DC267F` `#994F00` `#40B0A6` `#B66DFF` | Commit-graph lane cycle (lane % 5) — colour-blind-safe. The timeline is a single flat lane today (dot = `focus_ring`); reserved for multi-lane DAG rendering |

### Theme helpers (alpha-composited backgrounds)

Constructed on the `Theme` struct so call sites stop hand-rolling `Hsla { a: 0.22, .. }`:

| Helper | Returns | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `theme.diff_added_bg()` | `Hsla { a: 0.22, ..status_added }` | Per-line added highlight in diff view |
| `theme.diff_removed_bg()` | `Hsla { a: 0.22, ..status_removed }` | Per-line removed highlight in diff view |

No brand accent in v1. The brand *is* the absence of accent. Adding one is a Phase 8
decision, not a Phase 0 one.

## Palette — Paper (light)

Same tokens, same jobs — only the values move, so the "Use" column above still applies.
Listed on its own rather than as a second column because the reasoning is shared and the
notes are long; what differs is spelled out under **Mode**.

| Token | Hex | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `bg_base` | `#FFFFFF` | The content canvas stays white |
| `bg_panel` | `#F4F5F7` | Chrome sits a step *below* the canvas |
| `bg_panel_alt` | `#E8EBEF` | |
| `bg_overlay` | `#FFFFFF` | Back to canvas white; the border and shadow carry the elevation |
| `bg_rail` | `#EDEFF3` | Below `bg_panel`, the mirror of charcoal's lift |
| `fg_base` | `#1A1D21` | Near-black, not black — `#000` on `#FFF` reads as glare |
| `fg_muted` | `#5C6570` | |
| `fg_subtle` | `#8A929C` | |
| `border_inactive` | black @ 10% | Polarity flip |
| `border_active` | `#AEB6C0` | |
| `edge_highlight` | black @ 5% | A faint dark rule; the "catching light" metaphor does not survive |
| `hover_overlay` | black @ 5% | Lower alpha than charcoal's 6% — see **Mode** |
| `border_input` | black @ 18% | |
| `selection` | `#D3E3F7` | |
| `focus_ring` | `#2F6FB5` | |
| `match_bg_current` | `#F2C14E` | |
| `match_bg_other` | `#F0E6C8` | A pale wash — a mid-tone fill on white reads as loud as the highlight it sits behind |
| `match_fg` | `#1A1D21` | |
| `status_ok` | `#2E7D32` | Every status hue darkens to carry on white |
| `status_warn` | `#B37400` | |
| `status_error` | `#C0392B` | |
| `status_info` | `#1F6FB2` | |
| `status_muted` | `#8A929C` | |
| `status_added` | `#1E7A3C` | |
| `status_removed` | `#C0392B` | |
| `status_warning` | `#A97A20` | |
| `graph_lane_colors[0..5]` | `#B37400` `#C2185B` `#7A3E00` `#00796B` `#7B3FBF` | Same colour-blind-safe five hues, darkened |

Git decorations and the syntax palette move with them. The syntax set is VS Code's
**Light+** token hues, deliberately — charcoal's is Dark+, so the pair stays the same
well-worn relationship rather than two independently invented palettes.

`crates/settings/src/theme.rs` asserts the properties this table has to keep: text lands
at the far end of the lightness range from its ground, the alpha overlays are the right
polarity, the ladder runs the right way, and every inherited accent actually darkened.
A palette pasted in from the wrong polarity fails the suite rather than shipping.

## Density

Tight is the default. The cockpit fits more on screen than the conventional desktop
editor by design.

| Token | Value (px) | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `h_top_bar` | 32 | Application top bar |
| `h_status_bar` | 24 | Bottom status bar |
| `h_tab` | 28 | Pane tab strip |
| `h_row` | 24 | Sidebar list row, file tree row (baseline) |
| `h_action_row` | 34 | Row hosting inline action buttons (stash entry, worktree entry) |
| `h_overlay_item` | 30 | Item row inside floating cards (context menus, pickers) |
| `r_card` | 8 | Panels, cards (`0.8×`) |
| `r_xs` | 6 | Buttons, inputs (`0.6×`) |
| `r_chip` | 2 | Inline chips, badges, toggle pills — intentionally tighter than `r_xs` (`0.2×`) |
| `r_lg` | 10 | Modals, floating sheets (`1×`) |
| `r_xl` | 14 | Largest floating surfaces (`1.4×`) |
| `pad_panel` | 8 | Panel inner padding |
| `pad_overlay` | 6 | Inner padding for floating cards |
| `pad_row` | 6 | Row left/right padding |
| `pad_tab` | 12 | Horizontal padding inside a tab chip — chunkier than a list row because the strip is the busiest hit area in the cockpit |
| `gap_inline` | 6 | Spacing between inline siblings |

**Picking a step when the shape falls between two.** Two rules settle most of
the cases the table alone does not, both learned from converting surfaces that
had drifted off the scale:

- **A square icon button is a button, not a badge.** A 20px or 24px tap target
  with a glyph in it takes `r_xs`, however small it is. `r_chip` is for things
  that sit *inside* a line of text. Several such buttons had shipped at 5 —
  off every step and a pixel from the one they wanted.
- **A surface flush against another takes that surface’s radius,** not the one
  its own size suggests. The slash palette, the mention overlay and the usage
  hint all abut the composer input, so all four are `r_xl`. A corner that
  disagrees with the surface it is joined to reads as a misalignment rather
  than a choice; this outranks "a popup is a floating sheet, so `r_lg`".

**Two user controls, and why they are two.** The table above is the `Cockpit`
preset at 100%. Both of the knobs in Settings → Appearance resolve into it, and
they are deliberately separate because they answer different questions:

| Control | What it moves | The question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Density preset (`Cockpit` / `Comfortable`) | Heights, paddings, gaps. **Not** type, radii, or rail widths | "I can read this fine, I just want more rows" — or less crowding |
| Interface zoom (80–160%, 10% steps) | Every density token *and* every type size | "This display is too dense for my eyes" |

`Comfortable` is `1.25×` each cockpit value, rounded to the nearest even pixel
so centred content never lands on a half-pixel. It is a rule in
`Density::comfortable`, not a second column of literals, so a token added to one
preset cannot be forgotten in the other.

**`h_top_bar` is pinned** — no preset and no zoom moves it. Its height is chosen
so the chrome row's vertical centre lands on the macOS traffic-light glyphs, and
those are positioned when the window is created; a preference changed afterwards
cannot move them, so a top bar that followed it would simply stop lining up.

**Dimensions that are not tokens.** Not everything with a size belongs on the
scale. A close glyph is 14px because that is the size of the glyph; a scroll
fade is 24px wide because that is where the gradient stops reading. Inventing
`d_close_button` for those would grow the token set with values no second
surface will ever share, and a token nobody reuses is a constant with extra
steps. They stay named constants and pass through `density.scale(N)`, which
applies the zoom but *not* the preset — a preset changes how much air sits
between things, not how big a glyph is.

That hatch is for dimensions only. A type size or a corner radius has a real
scale to belong to, and `xtask literal-lint` counts `.text_size(px(d.scale(N)))`
as a literal for exactly that reason: routing one through the hatch would make
it follow the zoom while still disagreeing with every other size in the tree,
and would slip off the ratchet on the way.

**How a change reaches the screen.** Views cache their tokens, so the refresh is
a pull: every `Render` impl that caches a `Density`/`Typography` calls
`TREX_settings::appearance::sync` at the top of its `render`, and the setter
calls `refresh_windows()`. A view that forgets renders at the old size forever
with nothing failing, so `xtask appearance-lint` fails CI on any that does. The
same lint rejects `Typography::for_appearance` outside the settings crate: it
sizes the scale and leaves the faces at the platform default, so a surface built
that way ignores a chosen font while everything around it obeys. The whole
answer is `TREX_settings::appearance::typography(cx)`.

**Radius scale.** Every radius derives from a 10px base with the ratio steps
xs `0.2×` (2) / sm `0.6×` (6) / md `0.8×` (8) / lg `1×` (10) / xl `1.4×` (14).
The table above is the whole set; `density_radius_scale` in
`crates/settings/src/density.rs` asserts it, so a value off the scale fails the
suite rather than shipping. A surface needing a radius not in the table takes
the nearest step — never a one-off number, and never a second inline copy of
one. `xtask literal-lint` enforces this at the call site: a raw
`.rounded(px(N))` or `.text_size(px(N))` fails CI. The ratchet in
`xtask/literal-allow.txt` that used to grandfather the stragglers is now
**empty** — every radius and type size in the workspace resolves through a
token, so a new row there is a regression rather than a checkpoint.

This scale is deliberately the same one shadcn/ui's `new-york` theme uses,
which is what the reference cockpit is built on — matching it is why TREX's
chrome reads as the same family rather than an approximation of it.

**Hover-only scrollbar (reference spec).** Scroll surfaces that grow custom
scrollbars use: thumb at 28% white-alpha resting, 48% on hover, 36% while
dragging; the gutter keeps a stable width (no layout shift on hover);
thumb appears only while the surface is hovered or actively scrolling.
Applied opportunistically as scroll surfaces get touched.

## Typography

Single font family. Numbers tabular everywhere for diff alignment and counters.

| Token | Size (px) | Weight | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t_sub_label` | 9.5 | 400 | Sub-label annotations (metadata subordinate to primary label) |
| `t_label_xs` | 10 | 500 | Tiny chips (LSP, branch) |
| `t_label_caps` | 10.5 | 600, tracking +0.5 | All-caps section labels |
| `t_body_sm` | 11 | 400 | Status bar, gutter, tooltip, file tree body |
| `t_body_base` | 12 | 400 | Body copy a notch above the cockpit default — Source Control file names and commit subjects |
| `t_brand` | 12 | 600 | Brand wordmark in top bar |
| `t_body_md` | 13 | 400 | Sidebar rows, body text |
| `t_body_lg` | 14 | 400 | Main content, terminal default |
| `t_display` | 21 | 600 | The one heading in the app — the onboarding welcome line. Nothing else is a landing page. |

**Font stack**: per-platform, because the *primary* family has to be one the OS
is guaranteed to ship. Defined in `trex-settings::fonts::platform`.

| | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Mono (terminal + editor) | `Menlo` → SF Mono, Monaco | `Consolas` → Cascadia Mono, Segoe UI Symbol |
| UI chrome | `Helvetica Neue` → Helvetica | `Segoe UI` → Tahoma |

The arrows are **not** a CSS cascade. GPUI looks the primary up verbatim, and
`FontFallbacks` only covers individual glyphs missing from a family that already
loaded — it does not rescue a primary that fails to resolve at all. When the
primary is missing, GPUI drops to the platform default UI face, which is
*proportional*: since `terminal_canvas` pins every glyph to a `cell_width`
measured from `'m'`, narrow characters then sit left-aligned in over-wide cells
and the grid reads as randomly spaced. Naming a font the target OS lacks is
therefore a rendering bug, not a downgrade.

**Either primary can be replaced** from Settings → Appearance, persisted as
`ui_font` / `mono_font` in `appearance.toml`. The picker offers only families
the machine reports, and every load re-checks the stored name against that list
— a font uninstalled after it was picked, or a settings file carried between
machines, falls back to the platform face with a line in the log rather than
resolving to a sentinel nobody chose. A replaced primary demotes the family it
displaced to the front of that side's fallback list, so a hand-picked mono face
missing box-drawing glyphs still gets them from the one that definitely has
them. Because the mono primary is now a free choice, the pane measures it: a
face whose `i` and `M` advance differently is named in the row as not
fixed-width. It is not refused — that is the user's machine and their call.

## Color Roles

Map semantic intent to tokens. When in doubt, reach for the role here before reaching
for a new hex value.

| Role | Token | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas | `bg_base` | Window background only |
| Panel surface | `bg_panel` | File tree, SCM panel, status bar, chrome strips |
| Rail surface (lifted) | `bg_rail` | Left rail only — header strip, nav rows, list, toolbar; its raised/active fills use `bg_overlay` |
| Raised (persistent) | `bg_panel_alt` | Alternating rows, selected row, nested panel fills |
| Hover (transient) | `hover_overlay` | Row/card/menu-item hover on every surface tier |
| Floating surface | `bg_overlay` | Pickers, context menus, dialogs |
| Body text | `fg_base` | Primary text in any surface |
| Secondary text | `fg_muted` | Labels, sub-rows, inactive tabs |
| Disabled / chevron | `fg_subtle` | Disabled buttons, gutter, chevrons, sentinel italics |
| Selection ("you-are-here") | `selection` | Text selection AND persistent-current row (file tree active file) |
| Focus / popover edge | `border_active` | Focused input, popover/context-menu border |
| Hairline divider | `border_inactive` | Section dividers, pane separators |
| Destructive verb | `status_error` | Danger button text, danger-row foreground |
| Status (signal) | `status_ok` / `status_warn` / `status_info` | Single-accent state indicators |
| Ongoing op banner | `status_warning` | Conflict banner, rebase-in-progress strip |

## List-Row Convention

One set of rules across every row surface (SCM file rows, file tree rows, search
results, picker rows, left-rail workspace rows).

| State | Background | Foreground | Extra |
|---|---|---|---|
| Idle | transparent | `fg_base` | — |
| Hover | `hover_overlay` | `fg_base` | alpha-white — same perceived step on panel, rail, and overlay surfaces |
| Selected (click) | `bg_panel_alt` | `fg_base` | 1px `border_active` outline |
| Active / current (persistent) | `selection` | `fg_base` | — |

The hover/selected distinction is the 1px outline: hover is the soft prelude;
selected commits to a click. Active is reserved for "this is what you're focused
on right now" — file tree's currently-open file is the canonical example.

**Narrow-width collapse priority.** A row's *content* (name, path, message)
yields before its *controls* (counts, status badge, action cluster). The
flexible content column takes `.flex_1().min_w(px(0.0)).truncate()` so a long
value ellipsizes (`…`); the trailing controls take `.flex_shrink_0()` so they
stay fully visible at any panel width. Without `min_w(0)` a flex child refuses
to shrink below its content and shoves the controls off the panel edge (the
classic clipped-`Drop`-on-a-narrow-stash-row bug). Canonical refs:
`git_panel::row_renderer` (file rows), `source_control::graph_row` (commit
rows), `stash_panel` (stash rows).

### Progressive disclosure (secondary row actions)

Secondary, row-scoped actions stay hidden until the row is hovered, so dense
surfaces read calm at rest and reveal their verbs on approach. Identity/content
(name, status badge, counts) is always visible; only the *action* chrome ghosts
out.

- **Mechanism:** `.group(row_id)` on the row + `.invisible()` (or
  `.opacity(0.0)`) on the action, lifted with `.group_hover(row_id, |s|
  s.visible())`. The row id is the hover scope — it must be stable and unique
  per row.
- **Canonical surfaces:** tab-strip close `×` (also shown while the tab is
  active), left-rail workspace-card trailing `…`, SCM file-row action cluster
  (Stage / Unstage / Discard — the status badge cross-fades to the actions).
- **Never hide the only path.** A fully-hidden action MUST have an alternative
  invocation (context menu + tooltip). Where a surface has no context-menu
  fallback, ghost the cluster to a low resting opacity instead of hiding it
  outright, so every verb stays reachable — see the stash-panel exception below.

### Left-rail workspace ordering & display options

The "Projects" header carries exactly three actions — a display-options icon
(`settings-2`), add-project (`folder-plus`), and new-workspace (`plus`) — keeping
the header calm. Sort, grouping, card layout, and collapse-all live behind the
options icon in a single anchored dropdown (same occluding-backdrop popover
contract as `row_menu` / `dashboard_status_menu`). The scroll-to-active
crosshair lives in the bottom toolbar, not the header.

Persisted display state:

- **Sort** (`left_rail_sort_mode`): **Name** (case-insensitive alphabetical) ·
  **Smart** (default; rows needing action and running agents float up, reusing
  the agents-dashboard attention tiers, stable within a tier) · **Recent**
  (newest first) · **Project** (by owning project, then name — only distinct in
  the flat list) · **Manual** (stored order; the only mode where worktree rows
  are drag-reorderable).
- **Group by** (`left_rail_group_mode`): **Project** (default; rows nested under
  collapsible project headers) · **None** (one flat globally-sorted list, no
  headers, drag-reorder disabled since cross-project order is undefined).
- **Card layout**: Detailed / Compact (see the `compact_cards` exception below).

In grouped mode the primary (repo-root) row is pinned first within each group —
it is the project's anchor; only the worktree tail reorders. The flat list has
no *primary* anchoring (rows from different projects intermingle), but explicitly
**pinned** rows still float to the top regardless of mode. Manual mode in the
flat list has no drag affordance, so it degrades to pinned-first then stable
insertion order.

### Approved exceptions (documented locally; do not refactor without paired UX call)

| Surface | Height | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `file_tree_view::FILE_TREE_ROW_H` | 22 (vs `h_row` 24) | Scan-heavy navigation; compact rows pack more files |
| `search_panel::result_row::FILE_ROW_H` | 22 (vs `h_row` 24) | Same scan-heavy rationale; consistent with file tree |
| `search_panel::result_row::MATCH_ROW_H` | 18 | Per-line match rows pack tighter so a 10-match file fits in one screenful |
| `source_control::branch_picker::ROW_HEIGHT` | 28 (vs `h_overlay_item` 30) | Branch lists are long; more items in a tight popover |
| `left_rail::row_menu::ROW_MENU_ITEM_H` | 28 (vs `h_overlay_item` 30) | Narrow rail context reads tighter at 28px |
| `project_picker::ROW_HEIGHT` | 40 + `ROW_PAD_X` 16 | Modal-scale picker, not floating overlay |
| `workspace_card::CARD_HEIGHT_MULT` | 2.2 × `h_row` | Two-line rich card (name + agent verb/diff) |
| `workspace_card` compact mode | `h_row` (single line) | Opt-in compact card density: drops the second line (agent verb / diff) for users with many workspaces; toggled from the display-options dropdown and persisted |
| `stash_panel::STASH_ACTION_REST_OPACITY` | cluster ghosted to 0.45 at rest (vs fully hidden) | No context-menu fallback for stash rows, so Apply/Pop/Drop must never fully hide — ghost-at-rest keeps every verb reachable while still calming the row |

## Button Variants × Sizes

| Variant | When to use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `default` (primary) | The single affirmative action of a flow | Commit, Confirm |
| `secondary` | Lower-emphasis sibling to a primary | Cancel of a non-destructive flow; also the *disabled* primary frame |
| `outline` | Frequent non-terminal verbs; toolbar / standalone where filled feels heavy | SCM Publish / Stage / Push / Pull / Sync / Create PR |
| `ghost` | Icon buttons, row-row triggers, anywhere chrome should disappear | The default in compact surfaces |
| `danger` | Destructive **modal confirm** button | Reserved for ConfirmDialog primary |
| `danger_ghost` | **Row-level destructive verb** | Stash Drop, Worktree Remove — `ui::danger_ghost()` |
| `link` | Inline text actions inside paragraphs | Help text, learn-more |

Sizes: `default` (32px), `small` (28px), `xsmall` (22px), `icon` variants.
**Match the size to the surrounding row height** — a `default` button in a 28px
toolbar reads as a layout bug.

### Rule: solid `default` is the single affirmative only

Reserve the solid-white `default`/`.primary()` fill for the *one* true affirmative
of a flow — **Commit** (and modal **Confirm**). Frequent, non-terminal SCM verbs —
**Publish Branch / Stage All / Push / Pull / Sync / Create PR** — use `outline`: a
solid-white box per verb makes the panel shout one bright box at a time. The
SCM primary split-button keys its variant on the resolved `PrimaryActionKind` in
one place (`commit_area.rs`): `Commit → .primary()`, disabled `→ .secondary()`,
every other kind `→ .outline()`.

### Rule: action-menu hierarchy — focus the actionable, recede the unavailable

A verb menu (the SCM commit split-button dropdown is the canonical case) reads
top-down as "what can I do right now?". Render the rows to make that scannable
(modeled on common IDE git menus):

- **Enabled / actionable** rows carry `w_medium` weight and the menu's default
  bright foreground — *no* explicit color, so the hover highlight still recolors
  them. These are the focus; counts ride inline in the label (`Push (1)`,
  `Sync (↓0 ↑1)`, `Pull (3)`).
- **Disabled** rows recede to `fg_muted`. Their "why not" rides a hover
  **tooltip** rather than crowding every line — never an inline em-dash, which
  turns every row into a sentence and flattens the hierarchy.
- **Exception — review verbs** (Create PR / Push before PR): the path to
  enabling them isn't obvious from the label, so the reason also shows as an
  inline `fg_subtle` sub-line beneath the label (in addition to the tooltip).

Built with `PopupMenuItem::element(...)` (per-row custom render) in
`commit_area::build_menu_item`; the tooltip needs a stable `.id()` on the row,
which stays inert (no click handler) so the menu's own row dispatch still fires.

**Stable per-verb rows.** Every verb keeps its own always-present row rather than
one slot swapping labels by state — Push *and* Force Push, Pull *and*
Fast-forward are distinct rows; the state only changes which are enabled. The
menu shape never shifts under the cursor, so muscle memory holds. Order
(`source_control::dropdown_items::resolve`): Commit · Commit & Push · Commit &
Sync · ─ · Push · Force Push · Create PR · Push before PR · Pull · Fast-forward ·
Sync · Rebase · Fetch · Publish. Disabled logic steers between siblings:
a diverged branch disables Push (→ Sync), a lease rewrite disables Push/Pull/Sync
(→ Force Push), local commits disable Fast-forward (→ Pull).

### Rule: row-level destructive verbs use `danger_ghost`, not `danger`

Full `.danger()` produces a saturated red box that visually overwhelms the row when
it sits next to ghost siblings (Apply/Pop next to Drop, Open next to Remove). The
row reads as "one button is screaming" instead of "this verb is destructive".

`ui::danger_ghost(id, label, &theme, &density, typography, on_click)` renders a
transparent-background div sized like a `.ghost().xsmall()` button, with
`theme.status_error` foreground. The destructive intent reads through the color
without breaking the row's visual hierarchy. Defined in `apps/desktop/src/ui/buttons.rs`.

## Floating Surface Chrome

The canonical popover / picker / context-menu recipe:

```
bg     = theme.bg_overlay
border = 1px theme.border_active
corner = density.r_card
padding = density.pad_overlay      (6px)
item h  = density.h_overlay_item   (30px)
top edge = 1px theme.edge_highlight (white @ 6%, inset by the corner radius)
```

The **top inner-highlight** is the only way a no-shadow / no-blur surface can
read as *elevated* rather than flat: a 1px white-at-6% line catching light along
the top edge. It is non-interactive (a plain child div, no handlers) and painted
under the surface's content, so it never eats clicks. Keep it ≤6% alpha or it
stops reading as a hint and becomes a drawn line.

The chrome — background, border, radius, positioning context, and the
top-highlight — is single-sourced in `ui::FloatingSurface::floating_chrome`
(`apps/desktop/src/ui/overlay.rs`). Apply it in-chain where a surface sets its
size/padding; do **not** re-hand-roll `bg_overlay` + `border_active` + `r_card`.
Surface-specific padding, width, and content stay caller-owned.

Adopt for every new floating surface via `floating_chrome`. Today's compliant
surfaces: `pane_actions`, `adapter_picker`, `commit_context_menu`,
`file_tree_context_menu`, `tab_context_menu`, `git_panel/row_context_menu`,
`review_note_popover`, `pr_dialog`, `add_project_dialog`, `workspace_dialog`,
`project_picker`, `rename_tab_dialog`, `branch_picker`, `toast`,
`command_palette/palette_modal`, `stash_panel/push_dialog`.

**Chrome exception — `settings_modal/view`:** its card is `absolute`-positioned
at a computed anchor (`.absolute().left(x).top(y)`), so it cannot use
`floating_chrome` (which sets `relative` and would clobber the absolute
position). It keeps the hand-rolled `bg_overlay` + `border_active` + `r_card`
recipe and is not given the top-highlight. Migrating it would require applying
`.absolute()` after the chrome or reworking the helper to not force `relative`.

## Diff review notes

Per-line review annotations in the diff viewer. Three surfaces, all quiet by
default:

- **Gutter marker** — a fixed-width cell reserved on every annotatable line so
  columns never shift. A line with a saved note shows a filled glyph in
  `status_info`; an un-noted line's glyph is transparent until the marker cell
  is hovered, then a faint `fg_muted` hint — discoverable without peppering
  every line with a dot. Click opens the compose popover. Markers are baked
  once per prepared-rows rebuild (never per frame), like the staged slivers.
- **Compose popover** (`review_note_popover`) — Floating Surface Chrome; a
  multi-line `InputState`. `⌘↵` saves, `Esc` cancels, Delete removes. An
  emptied body on Save deletes the note (clearing the text means "remove").
- **Notes (count) cluster** — appears in the diff toolbar only when the scope
  carries at least one note: a count label (`Notes (3)`) plus `Send` / `Copy` / `Clear`
  text chips. Send formats all notes as one markdown prompt (file-grouped,
  each note carrying its line's code as a fenced block) and dispatches it to
  the active agent via `SendTextToActiveAgent`; Copy puts the same markdown on
  the clipboard; Clear drops the scope's notes.

Notes anchor to a stable `(repo, diff_ref, path, side, line)` coordinate — not a
render-row index — so they re-attach to the right line across folds, scroll,
split mode, and app restart. Persistence is SQLite (`diff_review_notes`); the
diff view rehydrates on every load. Send/Copy include code context in both
inline and split mode (the prompt is built from the render plan, not the
on-screen rows). Split mode does not yet paint the gutter markers (inline
only) — a deliberate v1 boundary; notes added inline still send correctly
while viewing split.

## CI checks + pull requests

The Source Control panel surfaces the branch's open-PR checks and PR actions —
quiet by default, no chrome when there's no PR.

- **Checks section** (`source_control/checks_section`) — replaces the one-line CI
  summary with a per-check list (status glyph in `status_ok` / `status_error` /
  `status_warning` + name + blurb) under a headline ("CI failing (4)") with
  `Refresh` and, when something failed, a `Fix failing` chip. A failing check is
  clickable: it expands an inline log peek (the run's `--log-failed` tail,
  monospace, byte-capped, in a `bg_base` scroll box). `Fix failing` bundles the
  failing logs into one markdown prompt and sends it to the active agent via
  `SendTextToActiveAgent`. Check data rides the existing PR-status poll (no
  dedicated cadence); the section collapses to nothing when there are no real
  checks. This lives in the SCM panel, not a separate activity-bar tab — checks
  belong with source control and reuse its poll.
- **Create-PR dialog** (`pr_dialog`) — Floating Surface Chrome, centered modal.
  Editable title + multi-line body + a draft toggle; `Draft from commits` fills
  the fields from the branch's commit subjects. `⌘↵` creates, `Esc` cancels;
  Create is disabled until the title is non-empty. Replaces the bare
  commit-derived auto-create so the user reviews/edits before opening the PR.
- **Merge** — when a PR is open, the SCM dropdown grows one row per method
  (squash / merge commit / rebase), disabled while any op is in flight. Merging
  never deletes the branch (the user's explicit choice). Remote PR ops show an
  In-Flight status frame ("Creating/Merging pull request…").

All forge calls (checks, log peek, create, merge) go through the `forge`
provider seam (`ForgeProvider`, one `gh`-CLI impl today) — never the CLI
directly — so a second host can slot in without touching these surfaces.

## Tasks page (issue/PR browser)

The left rail's nav rows are body-replacing **pages**, not just shells. The
workspace list is the **home** view: `active_nav` is `Option<NavItem>` where
`None` = home (nothing highlighted), so the app cold-starts on the workspace
list. Clicking a nav opens its page; clicking the active nav again toggles back
home. Agents (dashboard) renders in the rail body; **Tasks opens in the main
panel** as a pane tab (see below).

- **Tasks pane** (`tasks_view`, `PaneContent::Tasks`) — a GitHub/GitLab issue/PR
  browser for the active project's repo, fetched through the `ForgeProvider`
  seam. Unlike the rail-body pages, Tasks mounts as a **main-panel pane tab**: a
  wide 5-column table on the content canvas (`bg_panel`, **not** the rail
  surface). It is a **singleton** tab — the rail Tasks nav opens-or-activates the
  one tab (deduped like the Diff pane) rather than stacking duplicates — and is
  non-persisted (re-opened from the nav after a restart). A project switch
  refreshes it; opening it with no project shows a hint, not silence.
- **Toolbar** — one wide row of text chips (`r_xs`, active = `bg_overlay` +
  `fg_base`, inactive = `bg_panel_alt` + `fg_muted`): `Issues`/`PRs`, a flexing query
  box, `Open`/`Closed`/`All` + `Mine`, and `Refresh`. The **query box** passes
  its text straight to the forge search (`gh ... --search`), so qualifier syntax
  (`is:open`, `assignee:@me`, `label:bug`, free text) works without a local
  parser. Because the GitHub Search API ignores `--state`/`--assignee`, the state
  + `Mine` chips are **folded into the query string** while a search is active so
  chips and query compose instead of dropping each other; input is debounced
  (~300ms) with a generation guard that discards stale results. GitLab keeps the
  chips as flags and rides the query alongside as free text.
- **Columns** — `ID` (`#n`) · `TITLE / CONTEXT` (flexes: title + up to two label
  chips) · `ASSIGNEES` (`@login`) · `STATUS` (state chip: `status_ok` open /
  `status_info` merged / `fg_muted` closed) · `UPDATED` (compact relative age —
  `3d` / `2h` / `now`; a dash when the source omits the timestamp). A shared
  `COL_*` width source keeps the column header and the virtualized rows
  (`uniform_list`) aligned; columns fit-and-truncate (no horizontal scroll). A
  right-edge action cluster — `↗` (open in browser) + `+ Workspace` — is revealed
  on row hover.
- **Empty / unauthenticated states** — the body distinguishes three failure modes
  instead of one conflated string: no supported remote, an unauthenticated CLI
  (names `gh auth login`) or an absent one (names install), and a reachable but
  empty repo.
- **Create workspace from a task** — reuses `create_workspace_async`; the branch
  is `TREX/<slug>` derived from `"{issue|pr} {n} {title}"` so the number is
  legible. The workspace persists a `linked_issue` (`#<n>`, V011 column) shown as
  a `status_info`-tinted badge on its card after the branch chip, and the rail
  auto-activates it (selects + returns home, which also leaves the Tasks tab in
  the foreground). Manually-created workspaces have no linked issue and don't
  auto-activate.

Open-in-browser uses the shared `shell/open_url` helper, which forwards only
`https://` URLs — a crafted issue URL can't trigger another scheme through
`open`.

## Per-workspace tint

The **only** chrome customization in v1: an optional per-workspace identifier
hue, so parallel workspaces are distinguishable at a glance. It reads as an
*identifier*, not decoration — the dark-only "brand IS the absence of accent"
contract holds.

- **Vocabulary:** reuse the existing 9-swatch tab-color palette (`TabColor`) —
  no second color set, no new tokens. Persisted as a slug (`"blue"`) in the
  `workspaces.tint` column; `None` = default (pure charcoal).
- **Set via** the workspace row's "…" menu → a "Color" swatch row (clear + 9),
  dispatching `WorkspaceRoot::set_workspace_tint`. The current swatch gets a
  contrasting ring.
- **Appearance allowlist (accent only, ≤2px, never a fill or text background):**
  - ✅ the workspace's left-rail row — a 2px left-edge bar.
  - ✅ the active workspace's tab-strip — the active tab's top edge takes the
    tint (replacing the focus-ring blue); workspace-level, so every group's
    active tab in a split wears it.
  - 🚫 no full-panel washes, no tinted backgrounds, no tinted text.
- Contrast: the swatch is a theme-independent hex used only as a thin accent, so
  it never fights the charcoal surfaces or the single status-accent layer.

## Top-bar command center

The center chrome zone hosts a single VS Code–style command center — a
centered, clickable field that opens Quick Open. It deliberately does **not**
follow the reference editor's draggable tab strip in the title bar: chip
drag-reorder breaks inside AppKit's title-bar drag zone (`y < 28`), so the
title bar carries only plain click targets (toggles, this field), never drag
sources/targets.

- **Field recipe:** `bg_panel_alt`, 1px `border_inactive` → `border_active` on
  hover, `r_xs` corner, 22px tall, `max_w` 520px, centered. Content: a
  `search.svg` glyph (`fg_subtle`) + the active project name (`fg_muted`,
  `t_body_sm`) + a trailing `⌘P` hint (`fg_subtle`, `t_label_xs`). No active
  project → label "Search".
- **Behavior:** click dispatches `OpenQuickOpen`. Only the field takes
  mouse-down; the `flex_1` flanks stay window-drag regions, so the window is
  still draggable by the empty space on either side.
- Lives in `top_bar::command_center`, passed as the `center_header` center zone
  from `workspace_root`.

## Primitive-Picking Fork

When a control has multiple plausible primitives, use this fork:

| You want… | Reach for | Don't use |
|---|---|---|
| Hover-only label on an icon button | `Tooltip` | Custom hover div, title attr |
| Hover preview with richer content | Custom popover (no primitive yet) | `Tooltip` (no rich content) |
| Click → list of actions | Context-menu entity (see `commit_context_menu`) | Inline overlay |
| Right-click contextual actions | Context-menu entity, mounted at `WorkspaceRoot` | `DropdownButton` (different invocation) |
| Click → arbitrary content (form, picker) | Picker entity (see `branch_picker`) | `ConfirmDialog` |
| Decision-required blocking dialog | `ConfirmDialog` (`confirm_dialog/mod.rs`) | Inline overlay |
| Long-form modal (project list, settings) | Modal entity (see `project_picker`) | `ConfirmDialog` |
| Single choice from short list | Inline radio / split-button | Custom listbox |
| Single choice with filter | Picker entity with `InputState` filter | `Select` (no search) |

If you find yourself styling around a primitive (a context menu acting like a dialog,
or vice versa), stop — the dispatch semantics differ and a future contributor will
be misled by the mismatch.

## Motion

Disciplined, sub-200ms easing on **state changes** — enough to read as "alive,"
never enough to read as lag. Source of truth: `TREX_settings::Motion`
(`crates/settings/src/motion.rs`); every animated surface reads the same tokens,
so reduced-motion is a single switch.

| Token | Duration | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| `m_hover` | 120ms | hover cross-fade (only where affordable — see below) |
| `m_overlay` | 180ms | overlay / picker / modal enter (command palette) |
| `m_collapse` | 190ms | collapsible section expand |
| `m_toast_in` | 180ms | toast enter |
| `m_toast_out` | 140ms | toast exit (crisper than enter) |
| `m_exit` | 200ms | exit/dismiss for surfaces adopting `ease_in_exit` |

**Easing vocabulary (two curves, split by direction):**

- **OPENs** (overlay/palette/toast ENTER) use
  `TREX_settings::ease_out_spring()` — exact `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`:
  faster out of the gate than quint with a longer settle tail, so an opening
  surface reads "snapped into place, then settled". Monotonic, never
  overshoots (unit-test pinned).
- **EXITs adopting the accelerate-out read** use
  `TREX_settings::ease_in_exit()` — exact `cubic-bezier(0.7, 0, 0.84, 0)`
  @ `m_exit` (200ms): the surface lingers a beat then accelerates away, the
  mirror image of the spring open. Adopted opportunistically as exit
  animations get touched; monotonic, unit-test pinned.
- **Everything else** (closes, exits, collapses, flashes) keeps
  `gpui::ease_out_quint()` — dismissal and folding read crisp, not springy.

**Rules**

- **Bake once per state change, never per frame.** Wrap the element in
  `with_animation` keyed on a *stable* id that changes only when the state that
  triggers the animation changes. A per-frame rebuild that re-creates the
  animation each tick re-arms it and pins the CPU. Surfaces that unmount while
  inactive (palette while closed, section body while collapsed, toast before
  push) replay automatically on re-mount with a stable id.
- **Reduced motion is required, not optional.** Set `TREX_REDUCE_MOTION=1` (the
  seam a future OS `accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion` query or settings
  toggle plugs into) → the `Motion` global resolves to `Motion::reduced()`, which
  collapses every duration to a 1ms floor (instant, but not `Duration::ZERO` — a
  zero duration risks a divide-by-zero delta in the animator). Call sites don't
  change; they read the resolved global.

**Known GPUI constraints (documented, not faked)**

- **No transform-scale on `div`.** GPUI's `scale`/`rotate`/`translate`
  transforms live on `svg`/`img` only, not on a styled `div`. The reference
  "0.98→1.0 scale" overlay pop is therefore approximated with an opacity +
  vertical-offset (`mt`) settle — same perceptual beat, div-supported props only.
- **`.hover()` swaps instantly — no built-in hover transition.** Animating a
  hover bg/fg cross-fade would require tracking per-element hover state +
  `with_animation` *per row*, which is exactly the per-frame rebuild trap on a
  dense list. `m_hover` exists for the rare affordable single-element case;
  list-row hover stays an instant swap by design rather than forcing per-row
  state churn.

## In-Flight Feedback

The right question isn't *"should this control change while it's working?"* — it's
*"how long does the action take, and what does the user need to know during that time?"*

| Duration | Feedback |
|---|---|
| 0–100ms | None. Anything visible reads as a glitch. |
| 100ms–1s | Button disabled only. |
| 1s–3s | Disabled + spinner OR label swap. |
| 3s+ or multi-step | Stage labels ("Pushing…", "Fetching…", "Cherry-picking…") |

Two corollaries:

- **Pre-reserve any space you'll later occupy.** If a button may swap to a longer
  label, fix its footprint up front — a button that resizes mid-action looks broken.
- **Don't pick worst-case feedback for everyone.** Local-first ops feel instant;
  remote-only ops need stage labels. Bind the *disabled* state immediately so
  double-clicks don't double-submit, and the *visible* spinner on a ~200ms timer.

Reference: `source_control::commit_ops::run_remote` and `run_commit_verb` both
encode this contract via a single-flight `in_flight: Arc<AtomicBool>` flag +
status-row label updates.

## Toasts (transient feedback)

Quiet, transient, bottom-right. For *fleeting cross-surface events that have no
permanent home* — agent finished/failed, commit/push failed, PR opened, clipboard
copies. The status bar carries persistent repo/agent *state*; a toast carries the
one-shot "this just happened" beat that would otherwise be silent or buried in a
panel the user has scrolled away from.

Appearance (honor the floating-surface contract):

- `bg_overlay` card, 1px `border_active`, **no shadow, no gradient**.
- A single 2px left accent bar in the status hue — `status_ok` (success),
  `status_error` (error), `status_info` (info). Text stays `fg_base`. One accent
  per card; the bar *is* the accent.
- Auto-dismiss after a few seconds; stack capped (oldest trims) so a burst can't
  grow without bound. Non-interactive — never steals clicks from beneath.

When NOT to toast:

- **Routine fast local ops** (0–100ms per In-Flight Feedback) — no toast; the
  result is its own feedback.
- **Persistent state** that belongs in the status bar or a panel — toasts are for
  events, not status.
- **Approval / waiting-for-input** agent edges — those already raise the in-pane
  attention ring + OS banner; a toast on top is noise. Only terminal edges
  (finished / failed) toast.

Implementation: `shell::toast::ToastLayer` (per-window, mounted topmost so it
shows over modals). Events route via the free `shell::toast::toast(cx, kind, text)`
to the active window's layer (`ToastBus` global, refreshed on window activation),
or `WorkspaceRoot::push_toast` when the call site already holds the root.

## Composition rules

- **One accent per surface.** A row uses `status_warn` *or* `status_info`, not both.
- **Borders before backgrounds.** Use `border_inactive` to separate panels rather
  than a different bg.
- **Selection ≠ focus.** `selection` is for text and the active-current row.
  `border_active` + `focus_ring` is for the focused pane.
- **Focus-gain flash (splits only).** When focus moves between pane groups in a
  split, the newly-focused leaf gets a brief `focus_ring` rim (≤2px, ~0.28s,
  ease-out to transparent). It's a transient locator, not a state — the steady
  focus marker stays the tab strip's bottom border. Single-group layouts don't
  flash (no ambiguity). Reuses `focus_ring`; no new token.
- **No drop shadows** on dark UI. They look muddy. Use a 1px border in `border_active`
  instead.
- **No gradients** outside of the focus ring.

## Anti-patterns

Common drift, paired with the right fix:

| Don't | Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `rgb(0x141518)` | `theme.bg_panel` | Theme swaps must propagate; raw hex outside `settings/` is drift |
| `.text_size(px(typography.t_body_sm * 0.85))` | `.text_size(px(typography.t_sub_label))` | The arithmetic is a de-facto token without a name |
| `.h(px(density.h_row * 1.4))` | `.h(px(density.h_action_row))` | Same: arithmetic is a token in disguise |
| `const CARD_PADDING: f32 = 6.0;` (per-file) | `density.pad_overlay` | Eight pickers were each carrying this — one source of truth |
| `.rounded(px(2.0))` | `.rounded(px(density.r_chip))` | The chip radius is intentional, not magic — and a literal silently stops tracking the token when the scale moves, which is exactly what stranded 21 sites at the old values when the radii were rescaled |
| `.danger()` in a compact row | `ui::danger_ghost(...)` | Full danger weight overwhelms row hierarchy |
| `Hsla { a: 0.22, ..theme.status_added }` | `theme.diff_added_bg()` | Alpha tints belong on `Theme`, not at call sites |
| Two grays + a brand accent | Two grays + status hue when warranted | The brand IS the absence of accent in v1 |
| Bumping a font weight above 600 | Stick to `w_regular` / `w_medium` / `w_semibold` | Heavy monospace weights distort glyph metrics |
| Naming a new sc-style constant `TEXT` | `BODY_TEXT`, `GRAPH_META_TEXT` | Self-documenting names; shadow consts that mirror tokens are drift |

## Source-control panel local consts

`source_control/style.rs` carries a small set of SCM-specific consts that
intentionally diverge from the global tokens — kept local because the SCM surface
runs a touch looser than the rest of the cockpit:

| Const | Value | Why local |
|---|---|---|
| `PAD_H` | 12 | SCM panel uses 12px horizontal padding vs `pad_panel = 8` |
| `BODY_TEXT` | 12 | SCM body text vs `t_body_sm = 11`; file names scan from arm's length |
| `GRAPH_META_TEXT` | 11 | Graph metadata (author/date) — equals `t_body_sm` but named for context |
| `CAPS_TEXT` | 11 | Uppercase section labels |
| `SUB_LABEL_TEXT` | 10 | Conflict-kind sub-labels under file rows |
| `TAB_H` / `TOOLBAR_H` | 32 | SCM tab strip + toolbar; intentionally looser than `h_tab = 28` |
| `COMMIT_ROW_H` | 34 | Commit graph row height with room for ref-chip sub-rows |
| `ICON_CLUSTER_GAP` | 2 | Tight gap inside dense icon-button clusters |
| `LINE_COUNT_GAP` | 4 | Gap between `+N` / `−N` diff fragments |
| `ICON` | 14 | Inline toolbar/filter/chevron icon size |
| `COMMIT_H` | 46 | Commit message textarea height (compact 2-line composer) |

Future density preset (`Density::compact()` for narrow sidebars, v1.1) tightens
`PAD_H` to 8; render sites already route through `sc_style::pad_h(density)` so
the branch lights up without sweeping call-site changes.
