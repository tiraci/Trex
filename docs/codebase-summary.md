# TREX — Codebase Summary

**Updated**: 2026-07-31  
**Phase**: 5 + multiplexer enhancements + UI/UX batch (settings modal, Quick Open index, lifecycle scripts, Create PR + CI checks, floating PiP terminal) + Agent Chat (round-7) shipped to main; Remote Control Phase 1-2 groundwork in progress on `feat/remote-control-headless-registry` (agent-core split + SessionRegistry, not yet wired into the view); external-CLI auto-provisioning (bundled ripgrep + `cua-driver` one-click installer) shipped; desktop auto-update shipped  
**Tests**: workspace suite green on macOS **and Windows**. It was macOS-only until the six
`trex-macos-trust` tests that shell out to `/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/ditto` were gated to
macOS — the crate is a macOS-only *dependency* but an unconditional *workspace member*, so
`cargo test --workspace` had always run them everywhere and always failed off macOS.

**Tier-1 foldering (2026-06):** the formerly-flat top-level modules are grouped
one folder deep for traversal (each folder re-exports its submodules at the
crate root, so `crate::<name>::…` paths are unchanged):
- `app_settings/` — terminal/motion/scm_layout/keybindings/commit_message_ai/agent_launch/auto_update settings (host-level; distinct from the `trex-settings` crate)
- `agent_glue/` — agent_awake, agent_hooks_global, agent_status_hooks
- `session_restore/` — relay_cold_restore, relay_supervisor, restore_fallback, persisted_terminals, git_state_cache (several are `impl WorkspaceRoot`, so they stay in `app`)
- `platform/` — app_nap, single_instance, window_factory, window_registry, menu, relaunch (detached-helper "restart to update")
- `loaders/` — custom_commands_loader, `project_scripts_loader` (reads `.trex/scripts.toml`), browser_profiles, file_http_client
- `shell/terminal/` — the ~18 terminal-surface modules (terminal_view/canvas/row/links/palette/scrollbar/search*/context_menu/key_input/mouse_report/cell_metrics/box_drawing/adapter_picker/floating_terminal*)

At `apps/desktop/src/` root: `lib.rs`, `main.rs`, `actions.rs`,
`state.rs`, `assets.rs`, `workspace_root/` (split into mod/ops/render),
`left_rail_layout.rs`, `project_panes_factory.rs`, plus the `keymap_registry/`
and `notifier/` folders.

## crates/ui — shared widgets (trex-ui)

App-agnostic widget layer, extracted from `app/src/ui/` in 2026-06. Depends only
downward (`gpui`, `gpui-component`, `trex-settings`) and **never** on
`trex-app`; the host re-exports it as `crate::ui` (`pub use TREX_ui as ui`).

```
src/
├── lib.rs              pub mod buttons/overlay/confirm_dialog; re-exports danger_ghost + FloatingSurface
├── overlay.rs          FloatingSurface — overlay/surface chrome recipe (.floating_chrome())
├── buttons.rs          button variant wrappers (danger_ghost, …)
└── confirm_dialog/     ConfirmDialog modal (prompt + callback; pure is_match in logic.rs)
```

Generic dialogs that **stay in `app`** because they reach host state: `toast`
(uses `crate::motion_settings::active`) and `divider` (uses
`crate::shell::pane_tree::Axis`) — moving either would create a forbidden
`trex-ui → trex-app` edge.

`crates/core/src/lib.rs`:
- `AgentAdapter` enum gains `Custom` variant; `#[derive(Hash)]` added for registry keying

`crates/core/src/agent_session.rs` (domain types, zero tokio dep):
- `AgentSessionId(u64)` — field private; constructed via `new()`, read via `get()`. Unforgeable outside runtime.
- `AgentStatus` enum: `Idle | Running | WaitingForInput | NeedsApproval(String) | Done { code } | Failed(String)`
- Helpers: `is_blocking()`, `is_terminal()`

### crates/agents/src/thread/ — structured chat protocol layer (separate from the raw-PTY `cli/` runtime above)

Backs the **Agent Chat** view (`apps/desktop/src/shell/agent_chat/`): three provider adapters (Claude, Codex, ACP) each decode their own wire protocol into one `ThreadEvent` vocabulary. Full adapter-coverage matrix in `docs/system-architecture.md` → "Agent Chat adapters".

**Agent-core split (2026-07-18):** the pure fold + wire vocabulary + stream-json decoder (`event.rs`, `state.rs`, `entry.rs`, `tool_call.rs`, `question.rs`, `background_task.rs`, `tool_detail.rs`, `turn_diff.rs`, `context_chip.rs`, `stream_json.rs`) now live in `crates/agent-core` (`trex-agent-core`), a dependency-minimal crate (serde/serde_json/tracing only) so the same `ChatThread` fold can cross-compile for a mobile Rust core. `crates/agents/src/thread/mod.rs` re-exports every module under its original `crate::thread::*` path, so all downstream import sites are unchanged. Provider adapters (`connection.rs`, `claude_stream_json.rs`, `codex/`, `acp/`, `connect.rs`) and the codex/pi import fixtures stay in `trex-agents` — they need pty/ACP/tokio.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `event.rs` (agent-core) | `ThreadEvent` — transport-agnostic event enum all three adapters emit |
| `state.rs` (agent-core) | `ChatThread::apply` folds `ThreadEvent`s into `Vec<ThreadEntry>` the view renders; also tracks `last_summary` (Claude `post_turn_summary`, cleared each new turn) and `last_known_context_window` (stashed from settled `TurnUsage` + `LiveUsage`, feeds the context meter) — both in-memory only, not yet in `PersistedChatTranscript` (round-9 gap: a restored chat loses the context-bar denominator until its next turn settles) |
| `connection.rs` | `AgentConnection` trait (now `Sync`-supertrait, so a handle can hold it as a shared `Arc` across threads) + `AgentCapabilities` (incl. `supports_rewind`, `rewind_is_server_side()`) |
| `stream_json.rs` (agent-core) | Claude `stream-json` hand-parsed decoder; decodes `input_json_delta` fragments (live tool-input streaming) onto the tool card opened by `content_block_start`, ahead of the finalized `tool_use` block; routes `ExitPlanMode` requests (tagged `PermissionKind::Plan`); promotes `system/status` `compacting` → `CompactionStarted` (the in-progress compaction indicator) |
| `claude_stream_json.rs` | Claude connection; `set_mode` writes a `set_permission_mode` control_request on stdin (the Agent SDK's wire) so a composer mode change applies in place — no `--resume` respawn |
| `tool_call.rs` | `ToolCall` (incl. `subagent_log` — the buffered child-agent action log shown in the parent card) + `PermissionKind` enum (`Tool` / `Plan` / `Mode` / `Mcp` / `Other`) tagging every permission request for the card router |
| `codex_session_import.rs` | `import_codex_rollout` — reads a finished `~/.codex` rollout (Responses-API format) into a `ThreadEntry` transcript so a Codex session reopens as a chat (parallels Claude's on-disk log import) |
| `codex/protocol.rs` | Codex `app-server` JSON-RPC v2 message builders; `thread/fork` (server-side rewind, `lastTurnId`-addressed) — `thread/rollback` is the deprecated upstream alternative, not used; `account/read` + `account/login/start` (ChatGPT-OAuth sign-in) |
| `codex/mod.rs` | Codex connection; `AgentCapabilities::supports_rewind = true`; `pending_elicitations` map for MCP `mcpServer/elicitation/request` (distinct `{action}` reply shape from tool approvals); `codex_approval_policy` / `codex_sandbox` `FeatureControl` selects applied per-turn via `turn/start` overrides, persisted on the session struct; browser-OAuth sign-in via `account/login/start` (fire-and-forget worker emits `AuthUrl`) |
| `codex/map.rs` | Notification → `ThreadEvent` mapper; in-session turn ledger maps user-message ordinals to turn ids for rewind addressing; collab child-thread activity buffered + replayed into the parent tool card; unauthorized turn error → `AuthRequired` |
| `codex/approvals.rs` | Approval + elicitation decision encoding (`to_codex_elicitation`) |
| `acp/` | `agent-client-protocol` 1.2 adapter — generic tail for Cursor/Amp/other ACP agents |

**`crates/agents/src/session_registry.rs` (2026-07-18, groundwork, not yet wired into the view):** a process-wide, gpui-free `SessionRegistry` mapping `session_id → SessionHandle` — the event bus + command surface a remote (network) layer will subscribe to and command off the GPUI thread, built for the Remote Control plan (`plans/260717-2037-trex-remote-control/`). Each `SessionHandle` holds the shared `Arc<dyn AgentConnection>`, a seq-indexed bounded backlog replayable via `events_since` (reconnect gap-fill; the live `broadcast` channel alone can't replay past a lagging receiver), and an atomic idempotent-resolve gate so one `request_id` is decided through exactly one path. seq-assignment, backlog append, and broadcast happen under one lock so producers can't reorder the backlog. This is what forced `AgentConnection` to gain the `Sync` supertrait and the agent-chat view to switch from `Box<dyn AgentConnection>` to `Arc<dyn AgentConnection>` (`apps/desktop/src/shell/agent_chat/mod.rs`) — pure ownership change, no behavior change, so the registry can share the same connection the view drives.

**`crates/remote-proto` (`trex-remote-proto`, 2026-07-18, new crate, groundwork):** the Remote Control feature's transport-free wire vocabulary, shared by the future desktop host and the phone's Rust core. `proto.rs` — append-only postcard `Request`/`Response` RPC envelope, `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 1` (mirrors `relay-proto`'s versioning discipline). `messages.rs` — the request/response payload structs and the `HostEvent` stream frame. `pairing.rs` — `PairingTicket` codec for the `TREX://connect?ticket=` deep link (base64url-encoded postcard; `handshake_secret` redacted in `Debug`). `transport.rs` — the transport-agnostic `Transport` trait (framed bidirectional seam); iroh will be one impl, a `cfg(test)` in-memory loopback drives tests today. Only dep beyond serde/postcard/thiserror is `async-trait` (proc-macro, no runtime), so the crate stays mobile-portable. `ThreadEvent` and `PermissionDecision` carry `serde_json::Value`, which postcard (non-self-describing) can't deserialize, and both types are also on the persisted-JSON path — so on the remote wire they ride as a `serde_json` string nested inside the postcard envelope (`HostEvent.event_json`, `ResolvePermissionReq.decision_json`) rather than a shadow type or an on-disk format change. Enabled by additive `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derives on the reachable agent-core event types (`ThreadEvent`, `TurnUsage`, `AuthMethodInfo`, `AuthMethodKind`, `PlanEntryLite`, `PermissionDecision`). No host, client, or transport impl consumes this crate yet.

`apps/desktop/src/shell/agent_chat/` (GPUI views, not yet foldered into the Tier-1 map above): `plan_approval_card.rs` (Claude `ExitPlanMode` 3-way approval card), `tool_card.rs` (per-kind tool card renderer; `⤢` expand affordance on substantial cards), `tool_bodies.rs` (per-kind body renderers with a `full: bool` size-mode — inline caps vs lifted sheet caps), `tool_sheet.rs` (fullscreen tool-payload overlay: virtualized-diff `uniform_list` or capped-lifted text body, Copy + Esc/backdrop/✕ dismiss, reads the tool call live by id), `rewind_menu.rs` (shared rewind/fork UI; branches on `rewind_is_server_side()` for Claude disk-fork vs Codex connection-fork; "Fork from here" to a new tab reads Claude's on-disk `~/.claude` session log and is hidden for Codex, which has no equivalent log), `apply_patch.rs` (Codex `apply_patch` tool call's `changes` array → the shared `DiffLine` stream `diff_card.rs` renders, so a Codex edit shows the same colored diff card as Claude/ACP instead of raw JSON; diff rows are syntax-highlighted and memoized per `(path, line)` since the transcript is not virtualized and stream-delta batching repaints at ~20Hz), `session_detail.rs` (read-only popover of what a session advertised at `system/init` — model, cwd, tools, MCP servers + status, subagents — cached with the transcript via `SessionMeta` so a restored chat answers before its resumed process speaks; hidden entirely when the backend advertises nothing, which is Codex and ACP today). Attention notifications live in `apps/desktop/src/notifier/` (macOS `UNUserNotificationCenter` banners + dock badge, per-tab coalesced, focus-cleared, per-event toggles in Settings → Notifications); a real codesigning identity (`scripts/bundle-macos.sh --sign` / `TREX_CODESIGN_IDENTITY`) is required for the OS to honor the notification-authorization grant — the default ad-hoc-signed dev bundle silently drops it. **Worktree-per-agent, first-class `Workspace`** (`roster.rs` + `workspace_root/render.rs`): the New Agent composer's worktree pill + slug input stages the send, then routes up rather than creating a git-only worktree — the leaf carries no `WorkspaceRepo` (thin-leaf convention). `roster.rs` emits `AgentChatEvent::WorktreeWorkspaceRequested{slug}`, `pane_group/tabs.rs` dispatches the `CreateWorktreeWorkspaceForActiveChat{slug}` action, and `workspace_root/render.rs`'s handler resolves the active chat view (`active_agent_chat_view` on `pane_group/state.rs` + `project_panes/state.rs`, captured synchronously before the async step), runs the existing `workspace_ops::create_workspace_with_rollback` (git worktree **+** DB `Workspace` row insert, full rollback on failure), calls `mark_rail_dirty`, then hands the outcome back through `AgentChatView::on_worktree_create_outcome` (rebinds `cwd`, resumes the staged send). The worktree agent now gets a sidebar workspace card + `⌘J` entry and is removable via the Worktree panel; inline failure banner still offers Retry or "continue without a worktree"; hidden for non-git projects. The git-only `create_agent_chat_worktree` helper was retired.

**Composer control placement** (`composer.rs`): the draft's controls split by how often they change. Session **context** — the worktree pill (`render_worktree_picker`) and Import session — sits in `render_context_row` **above** the input; session **behavior** — attach, permission mode, model, effort, feature controls — sits in the toolbar **below**. Context is bound at first send and immutable after; behavior is retuned mid-session. Both rows live inside the composer's centered `max_w(CONTENT_MAX_W)` column, which is what keeps them aligned with the transcript at any window width. The worktree pill drives a `Popover` directly (not `render_dropdown_shell`, whose `PopupMenu` rows cannot host the slug's text field) and emits `ComposerEvent::WorktreeIsolationPicked(bool)` — the desired state, not a flip. **`ComposerView` keeps its own `unbound` flag**, pushed down by the parent: `sync_unbound_composer` owns the draft shape, and `sync_composer`'s bound branch must explicitly clear anything draft-only (agent picker, worktree pill) or it lingers against a live session.

`apps/desktop/src/shell/session_history/` — the `⌘⇧H` session-history / import modal (centered overlay, sibling of `command_palette`). `mod.rs` is the thin view (chip row, list, preview, keys); `picker.rs` holds the pure, unit-tested logic: `session_row_*` labels, the fuzzy filter, the `AgentTypeFilter` segment (`All | Claude | Codex | Copilot | OpenCode | Pi | omp`, cycled by `Tab`) + `filter_sessions_typed` (type gate ∘ query), and `entry_slug` (the row's registry slug for icon + resume routing). Default import (`↵` / click) is surface-aware via `AgentLaunchSettings::opens_as_chat(id)` — the single routing gate shared with the new-agent launcher (`workspace_root`): chat tab when the adapter's resolved open mode is `Chat` + chat-capable, else terminal resume. `⇧↵` forks, `⌘↵` force-opens as chat — including OpenCode/Pi rows, which open as a transcript-only import-bridge tab (round-7; see below) rather than a live chat. The index (`trex-agents` `session_log/session_index.rs`) sources Claude from `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` and Codex by scanning the CLI rollout store `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` (the same files `codex resume` lists) — each rollout's `session_meta` head yields id/cwd/git-branch/start-time and its first non-injected user turn the title; both rollout shapes (newer `response_item`+`session_id`, older top-level `message`+`id`) are handled. Three more providers are indexed by `session_log/import_provider_index.rs` directly from their own stores: **OpenCode** (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` `session` table), **Copilot** (`~/.copilot/session-store.db` `sessions`+`turns`), **Pi** (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl`), and **omp** (`~/.omp/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl` — same rollout shape as Pi's by fork lineage, read by the same parser; omp adds a padded `{"type":"title"}` record above the session header, its subagent child rollouts nest under a `<ts>_<uuid>/` dir and are excluded from the list, and resume is by the FULL canonical session id only — `import_resume_command` refuses anything shorter because omp's resolver prefix-matches with a silent cross-project fallback). These ride `AgentAdapter::Custom` + a `SessionEntry.preset_id` slug (not new core adapter variants); resume spawns a `Custom` PTY via `trex-settings::import_resume_command` (`opencode --session <id>` / `copilot --resume=<id>` / `pi --session <file>` / `omp --resume <full-uuid>`). Every source scopes by recorded cwd, degrades to "absent" on a missing/foreign store, and SQLite is opened read-only. The preview pane (`session_preview.rs`) renders a short blurb for all five providers via `load_import_provider_preview` (`opencode_preview`/`copilot_preview`/`pi_preview` in `import_provider_index.rs`, alongside Claude/Codex's own preview paths).

**Round-6 full-transcript mappers, wired to open-as-chat in round-7** (`session_log/import_transcript_opencode.rs`, `session_log/import_transcript_pi.rs`, dispatched by `load_import_provider_transcript` in `import_provider_index.rs`): map OpenCode's SQLite `message`/`part` rows and Pi's JSONL `message` lines into the same `Vec<ThreadEntry>` shape the Claude/Codex chat importers build. Consecutive text parts fold into one bubble; reasoning/thinking folds into the assistant entry's `thinking` field; unrecognized parts degrade to a plain notice row (never raw JSON). `⌘↵` on an OpenCode row now opens a chat tab seeded from this mapper (Pi and omp rows open LIVE instead — `open_pi_session_live` / `open_omp_session_live` spawn their real chat backends with the transcript pre-seeded; omp's live open also warns when an ambient omp is running in the same pane group, since a second writer against one session file is the hazard) — `pane_group/tabs.rs`'s `open_import_bridge_chat` builds an `AgentChatView::new_import_bridge` (`connect_now:false`, no live connection) and swaps the composer for a "Resume in terminal" footer (`render_import_bridge_footer`) that re-dispatches the existing `ResumeAgentSession` PTY resume via `import_resume_command`; default `↵`/click is unchanged (still resumes in a terminal). Bridge tabs are excluded from tab persistence (no live session id to restore against) and re-open from Session History, deduped on `(preset_id, session_id)`. Copilot's `session-store.db` `turns` table was confirmed to hold readable transcript text too, but Copilot has no chat surface in TREX to seed, so it stays resume-only with no transcript mapper.

## crates/dictation — offline voice dictation

Local speech-to-text for ANY focused pane — chat composer, terminal, or code
editor (⌘E). No GPUI dependency (mirrors `crates/pty`): the app consumes a
channel-based handle and never sees a cpal or sherpa type. Vietnamese-first —
Whisper is the default; a dedicated Vietnamese zipformer + Parakeet (English) +
SenseVoice (CJK) round out the catalog.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `capture.rs` | cpal CoreAudio capture on a dedicated thread (owns the `!Send` stream). Selectable input device (`run(device)`, `list_input_devices()`; cpal 0.18 → device name is its `Display`). Device-default rate (never request 16 kHz — macOS silence pitfall), downmix to mono, shared `SessionBuffer`, throttled RMS level events, 2-min hard cap. |
| `resample.rs` | Linear any-rate → 16 kHz mono resampler + downmix. Every buffer passes through before the engine (sherpa aborts on inconsistent rates). |
| `engine.rs` | sherpa-rs wrapper: `WhisperRecognizer` / `TransducerRecognizer` (NeMo Parakeet) / `ZipFormer` (icefall, incl. Vietnamese) / `SenseVoiceRecognizer` (single-file, CJK). CPU-only. Silence gate (int16 peak < 300), 30 s chunk splitter at the quietest 100 ms window (SIGTRAP #7925 mitigation). `ModelPaths.model` = single-file slot; `require_files` is kind-aware. |
| `vad.rs` | Silero VAD (sherpa's bundled `silero_vad`, no new dep): `keep_speech` segments a 16 kHz buffer into speech spans and drops silence before decode (also kills whisper's silence hallucination). `ensure_downloaded` fetches the ~629 KB `silero_vad.onnx` on demand (atomic temp+rename, cleaned on failure); missing/offline → caller falls back to the peak gate. |
| `custom_words.rs` | Pure fuzzy dictionary correction: `apply(transcript, &[word], threshold)` over 1–3-word windows, self-contained Levenshtein + length prefilter + exact-key shortcut, case/punct preserved. **No soundex** (coarse phonetic collisions over-corrected common words). |
| `text_filter.rs` | Pure transcript cleanup: `filter(text, language, enabled)` — language-gated filler removal (en/vi/auto; unknown langs remove none), bracketed/music-note strip, 3+-repeat stutter collapse, whole-output-only whisper hallucination guard. |
| `controller.rs` | Session state machine (Idle→Recording→Transcribing) on one worker thread + a warm **engine** cache (the VAD is NOT cached — sherpa-rs 0.6.8 has no full reset, so a fresh detector is built per recording). Idle teardown is the caller's `model_unload_timeout` policy, passed per session: `start(paths, device, vad_enabled, unload)` where `None` = never unload and `Some(ZERO)` = unload right after the decode; with nothing warm (or "never") the worker blocks on `recv()` instead of polling. `run_session` trims with `maybe_vad_trim` (best-effort) before the silence gate. Emits `DictationEvent` over a `futures::mpsc`. `Drop` only signals — never joins (no main-thread block). |
| `feedback.rs` | Optional start/stop capture cues (`audio_feedback_enabled`). Plays stock macOS system sounds (`Tink`/`Pop`) via `afplay` — deliberately **no audio-playback dep and no bundled assets**. Fire-and-forget (never blocks the GPUI main thread) but reaps its child in a short-lived thread so no zombies accumulate; no-op off macOS. |
| `model_catalog.rs` | 10-model catalog across 4 families (`Whisper`/`Transducer`/`Zipformer`/`SenseVoice`): whisper turbo(default)/small/large-v3/base/tiny, zipformer-vi + 30M lite, parakeet v3/v2, sense-voice. URLs HEAD/range-verified against k2-fsa `asr-models`; sha256 unpinned (`None`). `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` = `whisper-turbo`: it is the multilingual tier a bilingual (`auto`) user is stuck with, and it is measurably better at Vietnamese than whisper-small (19.8% vs 31.7% WER) while being a smaller download — at ~2.5s vs ~0.9s per decode. `recommended_model_id(language)` drives the Voice pane's "recommended" badge: a pinned `vi`→`zipformer-vi` (measured 10.2% WER), `en`→parakeet v2, else `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` (`auto` implies code-switching, so no single-language model is suggested). |
| `model_manager.rs` | Download (resumable HTTP Range) → optional SHA-256 verify → `tar` extract → file-existence gate → Ready. Disk is source of truth on init. Pull (`status`/`readiness`) + push (`ModelEvent`) APIs. (VAD's single-file `.onnx` uses `vad.rs`'s own fetch, not this archive path.) |

App glue: `shell/agent_chat/dictation_service.rs` (process-wide `Global`: one
`DictationController` + `ModelManager`; routes events to a `DictationTarget`
enum — the recording composer, or the global HUD for terminal/editor panes —
via `WeakEntity`; shared `prepare_start` pre-flight), `dictation_hud.rs` (the
floating "Listening…" pill + terminal/editor sink, mounted at `WorkspaceRoot`),
`dictation_ui.rs` (UI state + `WaveformBuffer` ring + smart-space helper),
`dictation_waveform.rs` (shared waveform renderer), composer recording bar +
mic device/hold dropdown, `WorkspaceRoot::dictate_focused_pane` (⌘E → focused
pane → sink), `terminal_view/input.rs::insert_dictation_text`,
`platform/mic_permission.rs` (`AVCaptureDevice` TCC), `settings_modal/pane_voice.rs`
+ `settings/dictation.rs` (`DictationSettings{input_device, mode, vad_enabled,
custom_words, word_correction_threshold, filler_filter_enabled}` →
`dictation.toml`; full-Whisper language table in `settings/dictation_languages.rs`).
`dictation_service::route_event` post-processes the Final transcript once
(`text_filter::filter` → `custom_words::apply`) at the shared choke point so
history + every target pane get the cleaned text. The Voice pane's custom-words
editor is an `InputState` on the modal (persists on blur/Enter, not per-key).

## crates/pty — terminal backend

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `backend.rs` | `TerminalBackend` trait: spawn/write/resize/snapshot/search_grid; dormant lifecycle (`spawn_dormant` / `promote_to_live` / `prefill_grid`); display-only `write_output(id, bytes)` streams external producer bytes into a dormant session's grid without a PTY child |
| `portable_pty_backend.rs` | PTY via portable-pty; bounded sync_channel(256); watcher thread per session; `write_output` override accepts dormant sessions only (refuses live to avoid racing the watcher on the parser mutex) |
| `state.rs` | `TerminalState`: alacritty_terminal + vte processor; user-tunable scrollback (default 5000) |
| `snapshot.rs` | `TerminalSnapshot`: cells grid + cursor; grid-text extractors `rows_text` / `get_content` / `last_n_non_empty_lines`; `abs_line_to_screen_row` maps OSC 133/633 mark lines into the visible viewport |
| `events.rs` | `TerminalEvent` enum: Output/Exit/Resize/TitleChange/Bell/CwdChanged/CommandMark/Progress/Clipboard/PtyReply |
| `osc7.rs` | `OscScanner`: OSC 7 (cwd) + OSC 133/633 (command marks) + OSC 9;4 (progress) sequence extractor — events alacritty doesn't expose |
| `close_grace.rs` | `term_step` SIGTERM-to-process-group + `close_with_grace(WatcherHandle, term_fn, kill_fn, GRACE, POLL)` orchestrator (5 s SIGTERM grace → SIGKILL fallback) |

## crates/computer-use — screen control for agents

Wraps a user-installed, notarized third-party `cua-driver` daemon (machine-wide
singleton shared with other MCP clients). This crate verifies/declares/gates
it; it never starts, supervises, or reaps the daemon process itself.

```

Full gate order + build-time bundled-ripgrep counterpart:
`docs/system-architecture.md` → "External tool provisioning".

## crates/macos-trust — shared trust primitives

Extracted from `computer-use`'s installer so it and `auto-update` don't fork
their own copies of the same codesign/spctl gate and crash-safe swap.

```
src/
├── lib.rs     SignaturePolicy { identifier, team_id }; TrustError
├── verify.rs  verify_signed() (codesign --verify --strict + -dvv identifier/
│              TeamIdentifier parse) → read_signature() (lenient) →

│              dir_size, free_bytes
└── exec.rs    run_bounded — bounded subprocess helper both callers spawn through
```

`computer-use` keeps only its own driver-specific policy constants; `verify()`
and the swap primitives now delegate here.

---

## crates/auto-update — desktop self-update (macOS + Windows)

Checks for a release in the background, downloads and stages a verified copy of
the app next to the installed one, and lets the app's own quit path do the swap
— the install is never replaced while TREX is running. Full rationale +
trust-anchor detail: `docs/system-architecture.md` → "Auto-update".

```

```

`lib.rs` presents the three verbs that differ behind one signature each —
`boot_housekeeping`, `apply_pending_update`, `relaunch_target` — plus a shared
`spawn_check`, so `apps/desktop/src/updater.rs` contains no `cfg` at all.

Public state machine: `UpdateStatus` (`Idle`/`Checking`/`Downloading`/
`Installing`/`Ready`/`UpToDate`/`Unsupported`/`Failed`), tagged with a
`CheckTrigger` (`Background`/`Manual`).

**Trust roots differ by platform, deliberately.** macOS pins the running
bundle's Developer ID and requires an update to match it. The Windows artifacts
carry no Authenticode signature, so there is no publisher identity to pin;
instead the payload is anchored to the minisign-signed `manifest.json` the CLI
already updates from, verified against `packaging/release-pubkey.txt` compiled
in by `build.rs`. See `crates/auto-update/src/windows/mod.rs`.

App-side wiring lives outside this crate: `apps/desktop/src/updater.rs`
(`UpdaterState` global, 6h ticker, boot sweep, quit-time swap via
`apply_pending_at_quit` from `on_app_quit`), `apps/desktop/src/platform/relaunch.rs`
(detached "restart now" helper — `/bin/sh` + `open -n` on macOS, PowerShell
`Wait-Process` + `Start-Process` on Windows; both wait out the old pid so the
new instance does not bounce off the single-instance lock), and
`apps/desktop/src/app_settings/auto_update_settings.rs` +
`crates/settings/src/auto_update.rs` (`auto_update.toml`: enabled,
last_run_version). UI surfaces: a passive status-bar pill when an update is
ready, a Settings → About toggle + status line + Check now / Restart now /
Download update, the app menu's "Check for Updates…" on both platforms, and a
one-shot "Updated to vX.Y.Z" toast after an update lands.

## crates/storage — SQLite persistence (Phase 4)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib.rs` | Re-exports `Db`, `open`, `open_memory`, `StorageError`, `Migration`, `MIGRATIONS`, and 5 repository structs |
| `db.rs` | `Db(Arc<Mutex<Connection>>)` newtype; `open(path)` (file-backed, WAL) + `open_memory()` (test helper, `#[doc(hidden)]`); `with_conn(|c| …)` closure accessor; `set_pragmas` applies WAL/foreign_keys/busy_timeout=5000/synchronous=NORMAL/wal_autocheckpoint=1000 on every connection |
| `migrations.rs` | `Migration { version, name, sql }`; `run_migrations(conn, &[Migration])` per-migration transactions; bookkeeping in `__TREX_migrations(version, name, applied_at)`; downgrade-by-max ordered before gap detection; `strip_sql_comments` helper so `contains_transaction_keyword` guard ignores prose; `migration_ladder_matches_files` CI guard |
| `error.rs` | `StorageError` (thiserror): `Open`, `Pragma`, `Migration{version,source}`, `SchemaMigrationDowngrade{db_version,code_version}`, `Query`, `Conflict{table,constraint}` |
| `model.rs` | Row types (`ProjectRow`, `WorkspaceRow`, `AgentSessionRow`, `PaneSessionRow`) with `from_row(&rusqlite::Row)` + `From<XxxRow> for Xxx` impls returning `trex-core` domain types; unknown `AgentStatus` slug degrades to `Interrupted` |
| `repositories/mod.rs` | Shared helpers: `now()` (RFC 3339), `new_id()` (UUIDv4), `classify_unique` (maps SQLite UNIQUE/PK extended codes 2067/1555 → `StorageError::Conflict`). Module doc locks the silent-ok-on-missing-row contract |
| `repositories/project.rs` | `ProjectRepo`: insert / get_by_id / list_recent (LIFO by last_opened) / update_last_opened_at / delete (FK CASCADE) |
| `repositories/workspace.rs` | `WorkspaceRepo`: insert (UNIQUE(project_id, slug) → `Conflict`) / get_by_id / list_for_project (excludes archived) / mark_archived / rename / delete (worktree-rollback contract) |
| `repositories/agent_session.rs` | `AgentSessionRepo`: insert (starts `Idle`) / get_by_id / list_for_workspace / update_status (3-column codec) / update_ended_at / list_running_at_shutdown (machine-checked vs `AgentStatus::Running.as_str()`) |
| `repositories/pane_session.rs` | `PaneSessionRepo`: insert / get_by_id / list_for_workspace (oldest-first restore) / update_grid_position / delete |
| `repositories/settings.rs` | `SettingsRepo`: get / set (upsert) / delete; caller enforces ≤ 64 KiB |
| `migrations/V001__init.sql` | 5 tables (projects, workspaces, agent_sessions [+ exit_code, status_detail for AgentStatus payloads], pane_sessions [ON DELETE SET NULL on agent FK], settings) + 3 FK-support indexes |
| `migrations/V005__per_window_persistence.sql` | Adds `window_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'main'` to `pane_buffers` and `pane_relay_ids`; rebuilds PKs to include `window_id`; backward compatible with existing rows |
| `migrations/V014__project_sort_order.sql` | Adds `sort_order REAL` to `projects`; backfilled at `db::open` from display order |
| `migrations/V015__workspace_sort_order.sql` | Adds `sort_order REAL` to `workspaces`; same backfill pattern. Migration ladder now at 15. |

`r2d2` deliberately **not** adopted in v1 — single `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>` over WAL is sufficient for the single-writer model. Read-pool split (write conn + N readers) is the documented upgrade path if profiling shows contention.

### file_tree/ — headless file-tree backend (Phase 5 step 3)

```
src/file_tree/
├── mod.rs      FileTree GPUI entity; TreeNodeId / FileTreeNode / FileTreeEvent
│               SKIP_NAMES const (shared filter list — prevents walker/watcher divergence)
│               remove_subtree: recursive eviction from nodes + open_dirs on re-expand
│               cx.spawn drives the watcher event loop
├── walker.rs   ignore-crate WalkBuilder::max_depth(1) + filter_entry(SKIP_NAMES)
│               returns (PathBuf, bool) direct children; sort_entries: dirs-first alpha
└── watcher.rs  spawn_watcher wraps notify_debouncer_full::new_debouncer (200ms)
                closure forwards DebounceEventResult into tokio mpsc
                is_ignored + find_node_to_invalidate are pure free fns
```

`FileTreeEvent` variants: `Loaded(TreeNodeId)`, `Refresh(TreeNodeId)`, `WatchError(String)`.  
Step 4 owns UI diffing; step 3 emits coarse `Refresh(id)` only.

Workspace deps: `lsp-types = "0.97"`, `url = "2"` (percent-encoding for file URIs).  
New action: `SaveFile` (in `trex-editor`; bound in `app/src/main.rs` via `use TREX_editor::SaveFile`).

## crates/relay — relay daemon (Phase 5)

│                   Calls purge_old_logs at startup; boots tokio + Server
├── server.rs       Server: UnixListener accept loop; Notify-based graceful shutdown
│                   Handles Request::Shutdown via Notify signal; SIGTERM/SIGINT handler

│                   SessionGuard ref count + spawn_idle_gc task (reaps sessions idle > idle_timeout)
│                   PidGuard (mirrors SocketGuard pattern — unlinks pid file on drop)
└── registry.rs     PtyRegistry: per-Entry AtomicU64 counters (bytes_in / bytes_out) + started_at Instant
                    PtyRegistry::stats() → Vec<PtyStats>
```

**relay-proto** (`crates/relay-proto/src/messages.rs`) additions:
- `Request::Stats` — ask daemon for live PTY metrics
- `Response::StatsOk(Vec<PtyStats>)` — reply carrying per-PTY counters
- `PtyStats { pty_id, bytes_in, bytes_out, alive_secs }`

**apps/desktop** additions (`relay_supervisor.rs`):
- `SupervisorError` enum: `VersionMismatch` | `Other`
- `read_pid` / `watch_pid` — 1Hz `kill(pid, 0)` heartbeat loop
- `ExistingConnect` typed variant for attach-to-running-relay path
- `pid_alive` via `std::io::Error::last_os_error()` (signal-safe)
- `boot_relay_supervisor` takes `PaneRelayIdRepo`; spawns crash heartbeat;
  branches on `VersionMismatch` → macOS banner, no auto-respawn

**scripts** additions:
- `scripts/trex-launchd-install.sh` — opt-in launchd agent installer; `plutil`-lints plist; refuses if token file absent
- `scripts/trex-uninstall.sh` — full uninstall hygiene (socket, pid, log dir, launchd label)
- `scripts/fetch-ripgrep.sh` — downloads pinned ripgrep 15.2.0, sha256-verifies vs the
  release's own `.sha256` asset, arch-matched (lipo for universal) + stamp-file cached;
  `bundle-macos.sh` copies the result to `Contents/MacOS/rg` and signs it nested-first

## Key runtime flows

### Startup
`main.rs` boots tokio → `Repository::open(cwd)` (best-effort) → `cx.open_window` → `WorkspaceRoot::new`. If no git repo at cwd, `right_sidebar` is `None`; RightSidebar hidden.

### Git polling
`WorkspaceRoot` owns `right_sidebar: Option<Entity<RightSidebar>>`. `RightSidebar` holds the `StatusPoller` + `GitPanel` + `DiffView` (SourceControl tab). `StatusPoller` ticks every 500ms (pauses on window blur), calls `send_if_modified` — only emits when state actually changes. On change: `entity.update(cx, …)` → `cx.notify()` → status bar center zone re-renders via `RightSidebar::latest_poll_state()`.

### Terminal data flow
PTY process → watcher thread → `state.advance(&buf)` → `TerminalEvent::Output` → 16ms poll task drains channel → `cx.notify()` → `terminal_view` re-renders visible rows only.

## CI guards (xtask file-size-lint)

| Threshold | Action |
|---|---|
| > 1500 non-blank LOC | warn |
| > 3000 non-blank LOC | fail (unless allowlisted) |

Thresholds were raised to GPUI reality in 2026-06 (large render/impl files are
idiomatic). A ratchet allowlist (`xtask/file-size-allow.txt`) grandfathers the
handful of files still over the hard cap at their recorded LOC: an allowlisted
file may shrink freely but fails the moment it grows past its budget, so the
debt can only go down (a `STALE` notice nudges dropping a row once its file
falls under the cap). Applies to all `.rs` files in `crates/`.
