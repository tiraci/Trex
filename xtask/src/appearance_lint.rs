//! Keep every token-caching view pulling the current appearance.
//!
//! Views are handed a `Theme`, a `Density` and a `Typography` when they are
//! built and keep them. That is deliberate — it keeps render paths total and
//! testable — but it means a live theme, density or zoom change leaves every
//! one of those snapshots stale. The refresh is therefore a pull: each
//! `Render` impl calls `trex_settings::appearance::sync` at the top of its
//! `render`, and cannot then be stale for longer than a frame. A view holding
//! only a palette calls `appearance::theme` instead, because `sync` wants all
//! three tokens and such a view has no other two to give it.
//!
//! The failure mode this exists to stop is the quiet one. A new view that
//! caches tokens and forgets the call compiles, renders, passes its tests, and
//! looks perfect — right up until someone changes the preference, at which
//! point that one pane stays behind at the old size while everything around it
//! moves. Nothing errors, and the reviewer of the *next* diff has no reason to
//! look at it.
//!
//! Unlike the file-size and literal ratchets this has no allowlist: the set is
//! small, the fix is one line, and a view that opts out is exactly the bug.
