//! Keep every data path resolving through `app_paths`.
//!
//! `app_paths` exists because ten modules each spelled
//! `dirs::data_dir().map(|d| d.join("dev.tiraci.trex"))` themselves. The
//! migration that introduced it converted most of them and missed seven, and
//! nothing noticed for a simple reason: on macOS `dirs::data_dir()` and
//! `dirs::data_local_dir()` are the same directory, so the two spellings are
//! indistinguishable there. On Windows they are not — `data_dir` is the
//! *roaming* profile — and the leftovers quietly wrote to a second directory.
//!
//! What that cost: the relay daemon writes scrollback checkpoints under the
//! local runtime dir, while `default_checkpoints_dir()` read the roaming one,
//! so crash restore looked in a directory that did not exist and reported
//! "nothing to restore" — indistinguishable from an empty checkpoint store.
//! The screen-control grant store landed in the roaming profile too, which on
//! a domain-joined machine follows the user to other machines; a record of
//! which agent may drive this desktop is the last thing that should roam.
//!
//! A unit test cannot catch this. The obvious one — assert the two `dirs`
//! functions agree — only ever ran on macOS, where it is vacuously true, and
//! asserting they *differ* on Windows tests `dirs`, not us. The property that
//! actually matters is a source property: nothing outside `app_paths` names
//! these functions. So it is linted, not tested.
//!
//! `home_dir` is deliberately not covered. Reading `~/.claude` or `~/.codex`
//! is reaching into *another* tool's files, which is a different thing from
//! deciding where TREX keeps its own.
