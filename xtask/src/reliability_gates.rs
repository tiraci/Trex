//! Validate `config/reliability-gates.toml` — the reliability claims ledger.
//!
//! Why this exists at all: TREX plan docs have twice carried a "VERIFIED" row
//! that was false. Once the evidence was a truncated `ls` that showed the first
//! screenful and was read as the whole set; once it was an API that genuinely
//! existed, just not on the host that mattered. Neither was a lie and neither
//! was caught in review, because prose has no shape a reader can check — a
//! sentence claiming coverage looks exactly like a sentence that has it.
//!
//! So the claim gets a shape. Every gate names the invariant, how you would
//! know it broke, and — the part that does the work — **where it must hold
//! versus where it is actually proven**. `platforms` is the claim,
//! `covered_platforms` is the evidence, and the gap between them is a field
//! rather than a silence. Both of the false rows above were exactly that gap
//! going unrecorded.
//!
//! What this checker deliberately does NOT do: assert that any test passes.
//! That is `cargo test`'s job and duplicating it here would make the ledger a
//! second, worse CI. This validates shape and internal consistency only. **An
//! uncovered platform is data, not a failure.** If that line ever blurs —
//! if contributors start deleting gates to get CI green — the mechanism has
//! failed and should be cut back rather than loosened.
//!
//! It is also a ratchet in the same spirit as `file-size-allow.txt`: a gate is
//! added when something breaks, not speculatively, and the honest thing to do
//! with a stale one is delete it.
