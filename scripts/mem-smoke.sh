#
# Five numbers, against a real `TREX serve` host driven by the real CLI:
#
#   boot_baseline_kb        RSS at readiness, no sessions
#   peak_retention_multiple growth right after the last reply / bytes streamed
#   retention_multiple      growth at STEADY STATE / bytes streamed
#   reopen_ms               `TREX transcript` wall time for a streamed session
#   idle_delta_kb           steady state minus peak; NEGATIVE means released
#
# The two retention numbers are not redundant, and measuring only the first —
# which this script did until it was caught doing so — is actively misleading.
# The host is still settling when the last reply lands: three consecutive
# release-profile runs put `idle_delta_kb` at +320kB, -30MB and -45MB, which is
# not variance, it is a sample taken at three different points of the same
# unfinished teardown. Peak is what the machine has to survive; steady state is
# what actually accumulates across a workday, and it is the one the plan's "no
# monotonic ratchet" goal is about. A gate built on the peak alone would flap
# by tens of megabytes for reasons that have nothing to do with a regression.
#
# The subject is the HOST process, not the CLI that drives it: the host owns the
# transcript fold, which is where this plan's allocations live. The CLI is a
# short-lived client and its own RSS says nothing.
#
# It measures the headless surface only. The GPUI window is not booted here and
# should not be — no CI runner in this repo launches one (every job is
# check/test/package), so a harness that required a window would simply never
# run. GUI-side residency — the sprite atlas, decoded images, the transcript's
# render caches — is therefore OUT of this number by construction. Measure that
# locally on macOS with the one-pager below, and do not read a green mem-smoke
# as a statement about it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# macOS one-pager: when a report comes in and this script says "fine"
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A GPUI app's residency is not all heap, so `ps`/RSS alone will mislead you.
# Split it:
#
#   footprint -p <pid>          Apple's own accounting: dirty vs compressed vs
#                               reclaimable. This is the number Activity Monitor
#                               shows as "Memory", and the one users report.
#   vmmap --summary <pid>       the breakdown that matters:
#                                 MALLOC_*        → the heap; mimalloc's domain
#                                 IOSurface       → GPU-shared surfaces
#                                 IOAccelerator   → Metal textures, the sprite
#                                                   atlas among them
#                                 __TEXT/__DATA   → mapped binary, not a leak
#   leaks <pid>                 only for a suspected true leak (unreachable
#                               blocks). Retention that is still referenced —
#                               which is nearly all of this plan's subject —
#                               shows up as nothing here.
#
# A growing MALLOC_* total with flat IOAccelerator is a fold/cache problem.
# The reverse is an image/atlas problem, which `remove_asset` (phase 2) owns.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Knobs
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   TREX_MEM_CHATS          streamed sessions to create        (default 16)
#   TREX_MEM_CHUNKS         delta events per reply             (default 400)
#   TREX_MEM_CHUNK_BYTES    bytes per delta                    (default 1024)
#
# The defaults are not arbitrary and should not be casually changed: they are
# exactly the workload `docs/memory-plan.md` records its baseline against, so
# that running this script with no arguments reproduces the documented numbers.
#
# **`retention_multiple` is only comparable within one workload.** Retention is
# strongly sub-linear in session count — a fixed per-session cost dominates
# small runs — so the same tree measures 18.3x at 6 sessions x 200KB and 8.4x at
# 16 x 400KB. Neither is wrong; they are answers to different questions. Change
# a knob and every threshold and every recorded number below becomes
# incomparable, which is worse than not measuring, because the numbers still
# look like they mean something.
#   TREX_MEM_IDLE_SECONDS   idle window for the creep number   (default 60)
#   TREX_MEM_PROFILE        debug | release                    (default debug)
#   TREX_MEM_CLI            skip the build, use this binary
#
# Thresholds (only consulted under --check; see "Variance" below):
#
#   TREX_MEM_MAX_RETENTION_MULTIPLE   default 12    (steady state)
#   TREX_MEM_MAX_IDLE_GROWTH_KB       default 16384  (only positive counts)
#   TREX_MEM_MAX_REOPEN_MS            default 5000
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variance — read before tightening anything
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Runner variance is real and a flaky gate gets ignored, which is strictly worse
# than a loose one. The defaults above are deliberately generous: they are set
# to catch a regression of the kind this plan exists to fix (a retention
# multiple in the tens, a monotonic idle ratchet), not to police single-digit
# percentages. Tighten them in a later phase, from numbers this script actually
# produced on CI across several runs, and record the observed band here when you
# do. Do not tighten them from one local run on a quiet machine.
#
# Observed bands (fill in as they are gathered):
#   macOS / M-series, release, 16 chats x 400KB, n=3:
#     boot_baseline_kb    19328 - 20016   (+3.5%)
#     retention_multiple  8.10x - 9.47x   (+17%)
#     reopen_ms           14 - 16
#   macOS / M-series, debug (the default profile), 16 chats x 400KB, n=1:
#     boot_baseline_kb    34976
#     retention_multiple  9.55x
#     reopen_ms           42
#   ubuntu-latest: not yet gathered — the CI job below is what will gather it.
#     Its thresholds are set from the macOS numbers with wide headroom until
#     then, and should be revisited once several Linux runs exist.
