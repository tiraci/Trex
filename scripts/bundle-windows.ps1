.SYNOPSIS
    Build and lay out the Windows TREX app directory.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Windows counterpart of scripts/bundle-macos.sh, and a much smaller
    script, because Windows has no bundle format to satisfy: an "app" here is a
    directory whose contents sit beside the executable. That flatness is the
    whole design. Everything TREX resolves at runtime, it resolves as a
    *sibling of the running exe*, so getting the layout right is the entire job.

    Output: dist/TREX/
      -Zip        also dist/trex-<version>-windows-<arch>.zip
      -Installer  also dist/trex-<version>-x64-setup.exe

    What ships, and what breaks without it:

      TREX.exe              the app.
      trex-relay.exe        the PTY relay daemon. Missing, every terminal
                              falls back to an in-process backend that dies on
                              quit, so sessions never survive a relaunch.
      trex-screen-gate.exe  the PreToolUse hook that decides an agent's
                              screen-control calls. Missing, every chat runs
                              unenforced: one warning in the log and otherwise
                              indistinguishable from normal. On Windows this is
                              the one that matters most, because synthesizing
                              input needs no permission there, so the hook is
                              the only thing watching. See
                              docs/windows-port-exclusions.md.
      rg.exe                  ripgrep, for the search panel and Quick Open.
                              Missing, search reports "ripgrep missing".
      *.dll                   the voice-dictation engine (onnxruntime +
                              sherpa-onnx). Missing, the app fails to start:
                              Windows resolves these at load time, not on first
                              use, so there is no degraded mode to fall back to.

    There is no signing step. Windows code signing needs a certificate from a
    CA; it cannot be self-issued the way an ad-hoc macOS signature can, so an
    unsigned build is the honest default rather than a placeholder. A signed
    release would add `signtool sign /fd sha256 /tr <timestamp-url> ...` over
    every .exe below, nested-first, before zipping. An installer produced by
    -Installer is not exempt: SmartScreen warns on the setup.exe exactly as it
    warns on an exe extracted from the zip, so the installer is a convenience,
    not a trust story. Signing would cover the setup.exe too, and must run over
    the payload *before* iscc reads it as well as over the setup.exe after.

    NOTE: this file is deliberately pure ASCII. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a
    .ps1 with no byte-order mark as ANSI, so a UTF-8 em dash in a comment turns
    into three characters and the parse fails several lines later with an error
    that names the wrong token entirely.

.PARAMETER Profile
    'release' (default) or 'debug'.

.PARAMETER Target
    Optional cargo target triple, e.g. x86_64-pc-windows-msvc. Omit for a plain
    host build. Only affects where artifacts are read from.

.PARAMETER Zip
    Also produce dist/trex-<version>-windows-<arch>.zip.

.PARAMETER Installer
    Also compile packaging/windows/TREX.iss into
    dist/trex-<version>-x64-setup.exe. Needs Inno Setup 6.3 or newer on the
    machine (`winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup`); it is preinstalled on
    GitHub's windows-latest runners.

.PARAMETER SkipBuild
    Assemble from whatever is already in target/. For the inner loop; never for
    a release.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/bundle-windows.ps1
.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/bundle-windows.ps1 -Profile debug -SkipBuild
.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/bundle-windows.ps1 -Target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -Zip -Installer
