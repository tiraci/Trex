# Fetch a pinned, checksum-verified ripgrep binary for bundling into
# trex.app. The packaged app spawns `rg` for the search panel and Quick
# Open; bundling it means a fresh machine needs no manual install.
#
# ripgrep is MIT/Unlicense dual-licensed — redistribution inside the app
# bundle is permitted (VS Code ships rg the same way).
#
# Output: target/bundle-tools/rg (+ rg.version stamp)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/fetch-ripgrep.sh                 # arch(es) from TREX_RG_ARCHS or host
#   TREX_RG_ARCHS="aarch64 x86_64" ./scripts/fetch-ripgrep.sh   # universal (lipo)
#
# The app is built native-arch (plain `cargo build`), so the default is the
# host arch only. Pass both archs solely for a universal app build.
#
# Caching: if target/bundle-tools/rg exists and rg.version matches the pinned
# version + arch list, this is a no-op — so offline rebuilds keep working once
# the tool has been fetched. A checksum mismatch is always fatal.
