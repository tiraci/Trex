.SYNOPSIS
    Install the `TREX` CLI and its relay on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiraci/Trex/main/scripts/install-cli.ps1 | iex

    What this trusts, and what it cannot
    ------------------------------------
    The release manifest is signed with the maintainer's minisign key and this
    script carries the public half ($ReleasePublicKey below). When `minisign`
    is on PATH the signature is checked before any checksum in the manifest is
    believed — the manifest and the artifacts come from one GitHub Release, so
    a checksum alone proves only that the download matches what the publisher
    said, which a stolen publish token rewrites.

    When `minisign` is absent this falls back to the manifest's sha256 over
    TLS, says so, and continues. Windows has no Ed25519 verifier in the box —
    .NET exposes none — so there is no way to check the signature here without
    that external tool. `-RequireSignature` turns the fallback into a failure;
    CI uses it.

    The installed binary does not inherit the weakness: it carries the same key
    compiled in, and every `TREX update` afterwards verifies or refuses. This
    is trust-on-first-install and only that.

    The archive is .tar.gz on every platform, unpacked with the bsdtar that
    ships in Windows 10 1803 and later — well below the ConPTY floor this
    project already requires.

.PARAMETER Dir
    Where to install. Default: $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\TREX

.PARAMETER RequireSignature
    Fail unless the manifest signature is verified.
