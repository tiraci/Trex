# What this trusts, and what it cannot
# ------------------------------------
# The release manifest is signed with the maintainer's minisign key, and this
# script carries the public half (RELEASE_PUBKEY below). When `minisign` is on
# PATH the signature is checked before any checksum in the manifest is believed
# — that is the whole point of signing it: the manifest and the artifacts come
# from one GitHub Release, so a checksum alone proves only that the download
# matches what the publisher said, which a stolen publish token rewrites.
#
# When `minisign` is absent the script falls back to the manifest's sha256 over
# TLS, says so in as many words, and continues. That is a real reduction in
# trust and the reason `--require-signature` exists; CI uses it. It is not
# silent, and it is not the default failure mode of a one-line install that
# most people run on a machine with no minisign.
#
# The installed binary does NOT inherit this weakness: it carries the same key
# compiled in and every `TREX update` from here on verifies the signature or
# refuses outright. This is trust-on-first-install, and only that.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose — /bin/sh is dash on Debian and Ubuntu.

# own trust chain — this costs nothing: anyone who can set an environment
# variable for this script can equally well edit the script.
