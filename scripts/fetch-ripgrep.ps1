.SYNOPSIS
    Fetch a pinned, checksum-verified ripgrep for bundling into the Windows app.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Windows counterpart of scripts/fetch-ripgrep.sh. The packaged app spawns
    `rg` for the search panel and Quick Open; bundling it means a fresh machine
    needs no manual install.

    ripgrep is MIT/Unlicense dual-licensed, so redistribution inside the app
    directory is permitted (VS Code ships rg the same way).

    Output: target/bundle-tools/rg.exe (+ rg.version stamp)

    Caching: if the binary exists and the stamp matches the pinned version and
    arch, this is a no-op, so offline rebuilds keep working once the tool has
    been fetched. A checksum mismatch is always fatal: a bundle whose search
    binary came from a truncated or tampered download is worse than a build that
    stopped.

    The pinned version is kept in step with fetch-ripgrep.sh by hand. They are
    separate files because the release assets, the archive format, and the
    checksum plumbing all differ; a shared version would have to live in a third
    file that neither script naturally reads.

    NOTE: this file is deliberately pure ASCII. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a
    .ps1 with no byte-order mark as ANSI, so a UTF-8 em dash in a comment turns
    into three characters and the parse fails several lines later with an error
    that names the wrong token entirely.

.PARAMETER Arch
    ripgrep release-triple arch component. Defaults to the host's.
