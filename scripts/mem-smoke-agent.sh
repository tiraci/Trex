# A stand-in agent CLI that STREAMS, for `scripts/mem-smoke.sh`.
#
# Why this exists next to `apps/cli/tests/fixtures/fake-agent.sh` rather than
# replacing it: that fixture answers a security question (does a spawned agent
# receive the confined credential?) and emits exactly one complete `assistant`
# message. A memory harness driven by it would report a streaming-retention
# number of roughly zero no matter how large the workload — the fold never sees
# a partial, so none of the per-delta allocation this plan is about ever
# happens. Extending the security fixture to stream instead would make its
# assertions race a thousand extra lines for no benefit to them.
#
# So: same stream-json dialect, opposite emphasis. Nothing here probes
# anything; it emits a controlled number of `content_block_delta` text deltas
# and then the complete `assistant` message a real Claude sends at block end,
# which is what makes the measured retention comparable to production.
#
# Knobs (read from the environment, since the host owns the argv):
#
#   TREX_MEM_AGENT_CHUNKS       delta events per reply            (default 400)
#   TREX_MEM_AGENT_CHUNK_BYTES  bytes of text per delta           (default 512)
#   TREX_MEM_AGENT_REPORT       file to append `streamed_bytes=N` to
#   TREX_MEM_AGENT_SESSION      session id to announce when the host names none
#
# The payload is deliberately plain ASCII words with no quotes, backslashes or
# newlines, so every line below can be assembled with `printf` and no JSON
# escaping. A payload needing escapes would put a `sed` in the streaming loop,
# which is the one place in this script where cost would distort the number it
# exists to produce.
