# The public half is written into the three places that must agree:
#
#   packaging/release-pubkey.txt   compiled into the binary by apps/cli/build.rs
#   scripts/install-cli.sh         the POSIX bootstrap installer
#   scripts/install-cli.ps1        the Windows bootstrap installer
#
# `packaging_key_parity` in apps/cli/tests/update_e2e.rs fails the build if they
# drift, which is the whole reason this is a script and not three manual edits.
#
# The SECRET half is printed once and never written into the repository. It
# belongs in the GitHub repository secret MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY, and nowhere else
# that is backed up, synced, or shared. Losing it means the next release cannot
# be signed and every installed CLI stops accepting updates until users
# reinstall; leaking it means an attacker can sign a release that every
# installed CLI will accept. Read docs/release-signing.md before running this.
#
# The key is generated WITHOUT a password (-W). minisign reads a password from
# the terminal, which a CI runner does not have; the secret's protection is
# GitHub's secret storage, not a passphrase.

Public key written to all three readers:

  packaging/release-pubkey.txt
  scripts/install-cli.sh
  scripts/install-cli.ps1

Commit those three together — a partial commit is what the parity test exists
to catch.

NOW DO THIS, then destroy the file:

  1. Copy the secret key:

       cat ${SECRET}

  2. GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository
     secret, named exactly:

       MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY

  3. Shred the local copy:

       rm -P ${SECRET}

The secret is NOT in the repository and must never be. Anyone holding it can
sign a release that every installed TREX will accept.
