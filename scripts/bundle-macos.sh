# Build trex.app for local use. Signs the bundle ad-hoc by default so
# UNUserNotificationCenter (desktop notifications) has a sealed identity;
# set TREX_CODESIGN_IDENTITY (or the legacy TREX_SIGN_ID, or pass
# --sign <identity>) to a real "Apple Development: …" / "Developer ID
# Application: …" identity for a stable TCC identity across rebuilds and
# to make notification authorization grants stick. Pass --notarize to
# sign hardened and submit to Apple.
# Output: dist/trex.app
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/bundle-macos.sh                 # release bundle (default)
#   ./scripts/bundle-macos.sh debug           # debug bundle (faster build)
#   ./scripts/bundle-macos.sh --debug-fast    # refresh binary only (~200 ms)
#   ./scripts/bundle-macos.sh --sign "Apple Development: you@example.com (TEAMID)" debug
#   TREX_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: …" ./scripts/bundle-macos.sh
#   ./scripts/bundle-macos.sh --hardened --sign "Developer ID Application: … (TEAMID)"
#   ./scripts/bundle-macos.sh --notarize --sign "Developer ID Application: … (TEAMID)"
#
# --hardened signs with the hardened runtime, a secure timestamp, and
# assets/trex.entitlements — everything notarization requires, without
# submitting. Run the app after this before notarizing: the hardened runtime is
# what breaks an app, and finding that here costs seconds rather than a full
# submission round trip.
#
# --notarize does all of the above, then submits, staples the ticket into the
# bundle, and reports Gatekeeper's verdict. It needs a one-time keychain
# profile (see notarize_bundle below) and a "Developer ID Application"
# certificate — an "Apple Development" identity, which is all a free Apple
# account issues, is refused up front rather than at submission.
#
# Ad-hoc ("-") is fine for exercising the UI, but `UNUserNotificationCenter`
# silently drops the one-time authorization grant for ad-hoc-signed
# bundles on some macOS versions — banners never appear even after
# accepting the permission prompt. Sign with a real identity to test
# notifications end-to-end:
#
#   1. `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` — if an "Apple
#      Development: …" or "Developer ID Application: …" identity is
#      listed, use its NAME as the --sign value (not the SHA-1 hash —
#      signature verification matches the certificate name against the
#      sealed bundle's Authority chain, which never shows hashes).
#   2. No usable identity? Create a one-time local self-signed
#      codesigning cert (never leaves this machine, no Apple account
#      needed):
#        a. Open Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant → Create a
#           Certificate…
#        b. Name: e.g. "TREX Local Dev"; Identity Type: Self Signed
#           Root; Certificate Type: Code Signing; check "Let me
#           override defaults" only if you need a longer validity.
#        c. Create, then in Keychain Access find the cert, expand it,
#           double-click the private key, and under Access Control
#           allow /usr/bin/codesign (or "Always Allow" when prompted
#           the first time you sign with it) — otherwise every codesign
#           invocation blocks on a keychain GUI prompt.
#        d. Re-run `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` to
#           confirm it is now "valid" and pass its name via --sign.
#
# --debug-fast: assumes an existing dist/trex.app and a fresh
# `cargo build -p trex-app`. Copies target/debug/TREX into the
# bundle without rebuilding the cargo target, regenerating Info.plist,
# or recopying assets. Use it for the inner UI-iteration loop; rerun
# the full bundle whenever Info.plist or assets change.
#
# The PTY relay daemon (trex-relay) is bundled as a sibling of the
# main binary. The app resolves it via current_exe()'s parent dir, and
# without it every PTY falls back to an in-process backend that dies on
# quit — so terminal scrollback/sessions never survive a relaunch.
#
# trex-screen-gate ships the same way. It is the PreToolUse hook that
# decides an agent's screen-control calls, spawned once per tool call by
# the agent's own CLI. Missing from the bundle, the hook command fails to
# run and the chat drives the screen with nothing enforcing it.
